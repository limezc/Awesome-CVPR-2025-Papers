| CoMM: A Coherent Interleaved Image-Text Dataset for Multimodal Understanding and Generation | Wei Chen, Lin Li, Yongqi Yang, Bin Wen, Fan Yang, Tingting Gao, Yu Wu, Long Chen | Interleaved image-text generation has emerged as a crucial multimodal task, aiming at creating sequences of interleaved visual and textual content given a query. Despite notable advancements in recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs), generating integrated image-text sequences that exhibit narrative coherence and entity and style consistency remains challenging due to poor training data quality. To address this gap, we introduce CoMM, a high-quality Coherent interleaved image-text MultiModal dataset designed to enhance the coherence, consistency, and alignment of generated multimodal content. Initially, CoMM harnesses raw data from diverse sources, focusing on instructional content and visual storytelling, establishing a foundation for coherent and consistent content. To further refine the data quality, we devise a multi-perspective filter strategy that leverages advanced pre-trained models to ensure the development of sentences, consistency of inserted images, and semantic alignment between them. Various quality evaluation metrics are designed to prove the high quality of the filtered dataset. Meanwhile, extensive few-shot experiments on various downstream tasks demonstrate CoMM's effectiveness in significantly enhancing the in-context learning capabilities of MLLMs. Moreover, we propose four new tasks to evaluate MLLMs' interleaved generation abilities, supported by a comprehensive evaluation framework. We believe CoMM opens a new avenue for advanced MLLMs with superior multimodal in-context learning and understanding ability. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.10462v2) | [https://github.com/HKUST-LongGroup/CoMM](https://github.com/HKUST-LongGroup/CoMM) |
| RoomPainter: View-Integrated Diffusion for Consistent Indoor Scene Texturing | Zhipeng Huang, Wangbo Yu, Xinhua Cheng, ChengShu Zhao, Yunyang Ge, Mingyi Guo, Li Yuan, Yonghong Tian | Indoor scene texture synthesis has garnered significant interest due to its important potential applications in virtual reality, digital media, and creative arts. Existing diffusion model-based researches either rely on per-view inpainting techniques, which are plagued by severe cross-view inconsistencies and conspicuous seams, or they resort to optimization-based approaches that entail substantial computational overhead. In this work, we present RoomPainter, a framework that seamlessly integrates efficiency and consistency to achieve high-fidelity texturing of indoor scenes. The core of RoomPainter features a zero-shot technique that effectively adapts a 2D diffusion model for 3D-consistent texture synthesis, along with a two-stage generation strategy that ensures both global and local consistency. Specifically, we introduce Attention-Guided Multi-View Integrated Sampling (MVIS) combined with a neighbor-integrated attention mechanism for zero-shot texture map generation. Using the MVIS, we firstly generate texture map for the entire room to ensure global consistency, then adopt its variant, namely an attention-guided multi-view integrated repaint sampling (MVRS) to repaint individual instances within the room, thereby further enhancing local consistency. Experiments demonstrate that RoomPainter achieves superior performance for indoor scene texture synthesis in visual quality, global consistency, and generation efficiency. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16778v1) | N/A |
| HEIE: MLLM-Based Hierarchical Explainable AIGC Image Implausibility Evaluator | Fan Yang, Ru Zhen, Jianing Wang, Yanhao Zhang, Haoxiang Chen, Haonan Lu, Sicheng Zhao, Guiguang Ding | AIGC images are prevalent across various fields, yet they frequently suffer from quality issues like artifacts and unnatural textures. Specialized models aim to predict defect region heatmaps but face two primary challenges: (1) lack of explainability, failing to provide reasons and analyses for subtle defects, and (2) inability to leverage common sense and logical reasoning, leading to poor generalization. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) promise better comprehension and reasoning but face their own challenges: (1) difficulty in fine-grained defect localization due to the limitations in capturing tiny details; and (2) constraints in providing pixel-wise outputs necessary for precise heatmap generation. To address these challenges, we propose HEIE: a novel MLLM-Based Hierarchical Explainable image Implausibility Evaluator. We introduce the CoT-Driven Explainable Trinity Evaluator, which integrates heatmaps, scores, and explanation outputs, using CoT to decompose complex tasks into subtasks of increasing difficulty and enhance interpretability. Our Adaptive Hierarchical Implausibility Mapper synergizes low-level image features with high-level mapper tokens from LLMs, enabling precise local-to-global hierarchical heatmap predictions through an uncertainty-based adaptive token approach. Moreover, we propose a new dataset: Expl-AIGI-Eval, designed to facilitate interpretable implausibility evaluation of AIGC images. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance through extensive experiments. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.17261v1) | N/A |
| Tora: Trajectory-oriented Diffusion Transformer for Video Generation | Zhenghao Zhang, Junchao Liao, Menghao Li, Zuozhuo Dai, Bingxue Qiu, Siyu Zhu, Long Qin, Weizhi Wang | Recent advancements in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in producing high-quality video content. Nonetheless, the potential of transformer-based diffusion models for effectively generating videos with controllable motion remains an area of limited exploration. This paper introduces Tora, the first trajectory-oriented DiT framework that concurrently integrates textual, visual, and trajectory conditions, thereby enabling scalable video generation with effective motion guidance. Specifically, Tora consists of a Trajectory Extractor(TE), a Spatial-Temporal DiT, and a Motion-guidance Fuser(MGF). The TE encodes arbitrary trajectories into hierarchical spacetime motion patches with a 3D video compression network. The MGF integrates the motion patches into the DiT blocks to generate consistent videos that accurately follow designated trajectories. Our design aligns seamlessly with DiT's scalability, allowing precise control of video content's dynamics with diverse durations, aspect ratios, and resolutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate Tora's excellence in achieving high motion fidelity, while also meticulously simulating the intricate movement of the physical world.

| SwiftEdit: Lightning Fast Text-Guided Image Editing via One-Step Diffusion | Trong-Tung Nguyen, Quang Nguyen, Khoi Nguyen, Anh Tran, Cuong Pham | Recent advances in text-guided image editing enable users to perform image edits through simple text inputs, leveraging the extensive priors of multi-step diffusion-based text-to-image models. However, these methods often fall short of the speed demands required for real-world and on-device applications due to the costly multi-step inversion and sampling process involved. In response to this, we introduce SwiftEdit, a simple yet highly efficient editing tool that achieve instant text-guided image editing (in 0.23s). The advancement of SwiftEdit lies in its two novel contributions: a one-step inversion framework that enables one-step image reconstruction via inversion and a mask-guided editing technique with our proposed attention rescaling mechanism to perform localized image editing. Extensive experiments are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SwiftEdit. In particular, SwiftEdit enables instant text-guided image editing, which is extremely faster than previous multi-step methods (at least 50 times faster) while maintain a competitive performance in editing results.

| G3Flow: Generative 3D Semantic Flow for Pose-aware and Generalizable Object Manipulation | Tianxing Chen, Yao Mu, Zhixuan Liang, Zanxin Chen, Shijia Peng, Qiangyu Chen, Mingkun Xu, Ruizhen Hu, Hongyuan Zhang, Xuelong Li, Ping Luo | Recent advances in imitation learning for 3D robotic manipulation have shown promising results with diffusion-based policies. However, achieving human-level dexterity requires seamless integration of geometric precision and semantic understanding. We present G3Flow, a novel framework that constructs real-time semantic flow, a dynamic, object-centric 3D semantic representation by leveraging foundation models. Our approach uniquely combines 3D generative models for digital twin creation, vision foundation models for semantic feature extraction, and robust pose tracking for continuous semantic flow updates. This integration enables complete semantic understanding even under occlusions while eliminating manual annotation requirements. By incorporating semantic flow into diffusion policies, we demonstrate significant improvements in both terminal-constrained manipulation and cross-object generalization. Extensive experiments across five simulation tasks show that G3Flow consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to 68.3% and 50.1% average success rates on terminal-constrained manipulation and cross-object generalization tasks respectively. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of G3Flow in enhancing real-time dynamic semantic feature understanding for robotic manipulation policies. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18369v2) | [https://tianxingchen.github.io/G3Flow](https://tianxingchen.github.io/G3Flow) |
| MotiF: Making Text Count in Image Animation with Motion Focal Loss | Shijie Wang, Samaneh Azadi, Rohit Girdhar, Saketh Rambhatla, Chen Sun, Xi Yin | Text-Image-to-Video (TI2V) generation aims to generate a video from an image following a text description, which is also referred to as text-guided image animation. Most existing methods struggle to generate videos that align well with the text prompts, particularly when motion is specified. To overcome this limitation, we introduce MotiF, a simple yet effective approach that directs the model's learning to the regions with more motion, thereby improving the text alignment and motion generation. We use optical flow to generate a motion heatmap and weight the loss according to the intensity of the motion. This modified objective leads to noticeable improvements and complements existing methods that utilize motion priors as model inputs. Additionally, due to the lack of a diverse benchmark for evaluating TI2V generation, we propose TI2V Bench, a dataset consists of 320 image-text pairs for robust evaluation. We present a human evaluation protocol that asks the annotators to select an overall preference between two videos followed by their justifications. Through a comprehensive evaluation on TI2V Bench, MotiF outperforms nine open-sourced models, achieving an average preference of 72%. The TI2V Bench is released in https://wang-sj16.github.io/motif/. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16153v1) | N/A |
| CarPlanner: Consistent Auto-regressive Trajectory Planning for Large-scale Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous Driving | Dongkun Zhang, Jiaming Liang, Ke Guo, Sha Lu, Qi Wang, Rong Xiong, Zhenwei Miao, Yue Wang | Trajectory planning is vital for autonomous driving, ensuring safe and efficient navigation in complex environments. While recent learning-based methods, particularly reinforcement learning (RL), have shown promise in specific scenarios, RL planners struggle with training inefficiencies and managing large-scale, real-world driving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{CarPlanner}, a \textbf{C}onsistent \textbf{a}uto-\textbf{r}egressive \textbf{Planner} that uses RL to generate multi-modal trajectories. The auto-regressive structure enables efficient large-scale RL training, while the incorporation of consistency ensures stable policy learning by maintaining coherent temporal consistency across time steps. Moreover, CarPlanner employs a generation-selection framework with an expert-guided reward function and an invariant-view module, simplifying RL training and enhancing policy performance. Extensive analysis demonstrates that our proposed RL framework effectively addresses the challenges of training efficiency and performance enhancement, positioning CarPlanner as a promising solution for trajectory planning in autonomous driving. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that the RL-based planner can surpass both IL- and rule-based state-of-the-arts (SOTAs) on the challenging large-scale real-world dataset nuPlan. Our proposed CarPlanner surpasses RL-, IL-, and rule-based SOTA approaches within this demanding dataset. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.19908v2) | [https://github.com/motional/nuplan-devkit](https://github.com/motional/nuplan-devkit) |
| Feat2GS: Probing Visual Foundation Models with Gaussian Splatting | Yue Chen, Xingyu Chen, Anpei Chen, Gerard Pons-Moll, Yuliang Xiu | Given that visual foundation models (VFMs) are trained on extensive datasets but often limited to 2D images, a natural question arises: how well do they understand the 3D world? With the differences in architecture and training protocols (i.e., objectives, proxy tasks), a unified framework to fairly and comprehensively probe their 3D awareness is urgently needed. Existing works on 3D probing suggest single-view 2.5D estimation (e.g., depth and normal) or two-view sparse 2D correspondence (e.g., matching and tracking). Unfortunately, these tasks ignore texture awareness, and require 3D data as ground-truth, which limits the scale and diversity of their evaluation set. To address these issues, we introduce Feat2GS, which readout 3D Gaussians attributes from VFM features extracted from unposed images. This allows us to probe 3D awareness for geometry and texture via novel view synthesis, without requiring 3D data. Additionally, the disentanglement of 3DGS parameters - geometry ($\boldsymbol{x}, \alpha, \Sigma$) and texture ($\boldsymbol{c}$) - enables separate analysis of texture and geometry awareness. Under Feat2GS, we conduct extensive experiments to probe the 3D awareness of several VFMs, and investigate the ingredients that lead to a 3D aware VFM. Building on these findings, we develop several variants that achieve state-of-the-art across diverse datasets. This makes Feat2GS useful for probing VFMs, and as a simple-yet-effective baseline for novel-view synthesis. Code and data will be made available at https://fanegg.github.io/Feat2GS/. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09606v1) | N/A |
| Visual Agentic AI for Spatial Reasoning with a Dynamic API | Damiano Marsili, Rohun Agrawal, Yisong Yue, Georgia Gkioxari | Visual reasoning -- the ability to interpret the visual world -- is crucial for embodied agents that operate within three-dimensional scenes. Progress in AI has led to vision and language models capable of answering questions from images. However, their performance declines when tasked with 3D spatial reasoning. To tackle the complexity of such reasoning problems, we introduce an agentic program synthesis approach where LLM agents collaboratively generate a Pythonic API with new functions to solve common subproblems. Our method overcomes limitations of prior approaches that rely on a static, human-defined API, allowing it to handle a wider range of queries. To assess AI capabilities for 3D understanding, we introduce a new benchmark of queries involving multiple steps of grounding and inference. We show that our method outperforms prior zero-shot models for visual reasoning in 3D and empirically validate the effectiveness of our agentic framework for 3D spatial reasoning tasks.

| INFP: Audio-Driven Interactive Head Generation in Dyadic Conversations | Yongming Zhu, Longhao Zhang, Zhengkun Rong, Tianshu Hu, Shuang Liang, Zhipeng Ge | Imagine having a conversation with a socially intelligent agent. It can attentively listen to your words and offer visual and linguistic feedback promptly. This seamless interaction allows for multiple rounds of conversation to flow smoothly and naturally. In pursuit of actualizing it, we propose INFP, a novel audio-driven head generation framework for dyadic interaction. Unlike previous head generation works that only focus on single-sided communication, or require manual role assignment and explicit role switching, our model drives the agent portrait dynamically alternates between speaking and listening state, guided by the input dyadic audio. Specifically, INFP comprises a Motion-Based Head Imitation stage and an Audio-Guided Motion Generation stage. The first stage learns to project facial communicative behaviors from real-life conversation videos into a low-dimensional motion latent space, and use the motion latent codes to animate a static image. The second stage learns the mapping from the input dyadic audio to motion latent codes through denoising, leading to the audio-driven head generation in interactive scenarios. To facilitate this line of research, we introduce DyConv, a large scale dataset of rich dyadic conversations collected from the Internet. Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate superior performance and effectiveness of our method.

| Generalizing Deepfake Video Detection with Plug-and-Play: Video-Level Blending and Spatiotemporal Adapter Tuning | Zhiyuan Yan, Yandan Zhao, Shen Chen, Mingyi Guo, Xinghe Fu, Taiping Yao, Shouhong Ding, Li Yuan | Three key challenges hinder the development of current deepfake video detection: (1) Temporal features can be complex and diverse: how can we identify general temporal artifacts to enhance model generalization? (2) Spatiotemporal models often lean heavily on one type of artifact and ignore the other: how can we ensure balanced learning from both? (3) Videos are naturally resource-intensive: how can we tackle efficiency without compromising accuracy? This paper attempts to tackle the three challenges jointly. First, inspired by the notable generality of using image-level blending data for image forgery detection, we investigate whether and how video-level blending can be effective in video. We then perform a thorough analysis and identify a previously underexplored temporal forgery artifact: Facial Feature Drift (FFD), which commonly exists across different forgeries. To reproduce FFD, we then propose a novel Video-level Blending data (VB), where VB is implemented by blending the original image and its warped version frame-by-frame, serving as a hard negative sample to mine more general artifacts. Second, we carefully design a lightweight Spatiotemporal Adapter (StA) to equip a pretrained image model (both ViTs and CNNs) with the ability to capture both spatial and temporal features jointly and efficiently. StA is designed with two-stream 3D-Conv with varying kernel sizes, allowing it to process spatial and temporal features separately. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods; and show our approach can generalize well to previously unseen forgery videos, even the latest generation methods. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.17065v2) | N/A |
| Advancing Semantic Future Prediction through Multimodal Visual Sequence Transformers | Efstathios Karypidis, Ioannis Kakogeorgiou, Spyros Gidaris, Nikos Komodakis | Semantic future prediction is important for autonomous systems navigating dynamic environments. This paper introduces FUTURIST, a method for multimodal future semantic prediction that uses a unified and efficient visual sequence transformer architecture. Our approach incorporates a multimodal masked visual modeling objective and a novel masking mechanism designed for multimodal training. This allows the model to effectively integrate visible information from various modalities, improving prediction accuracy. Additionally, we propose a VAE-free hierarchical tokenization process, which reduces computational complexity, streamlines the training pipeline, and enables end-to-end training with high-resolution, multimodal inputs. We validate FUTURIST on the Cityscapes dataset, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in future semantic segmentation for both short- and mid-term forecasting. We provide the implementation code at https://github.com/Sta8is/FUTURIST . | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08303v1) | [https://github.com/Sta8is/FUTURIST](https://github.com/Sta8is/FUTURIST) |
| Toward Robust Neural Reconstruction from Sparse Point Sets | Amine Ouasfi, Shubhendu Jena, Eric Marchand, Adnane Boukhayma | We consider the challenging problem of learning Signed Distance Functions (SDF) from sparse and noisy 3D point clouds. In contrast to recent methods that depend on smoothness priors, our method, rooted in a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) framework, incorporates a regularization term that leverages samples from the uncertainty regions of the model to improve the learned SDFs. Thanks to tractable dual formulations, we show that this framework enables a stable and efficient optimization of SDFs in the absence of ground truth supervision. Using a variety of synthetic and real data evaluations from different modalities, we show that our DRO based learning framework can improve SDF learning with respect to baselines and the state-of-the-art methods. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16361v1) | N/A |
| Align3R: Aligned Monocular Depth Estimation for Dynamic Videos | Jiahao Lu, Tianyu Huang, Peng Li, Zhiyang Dou, Cheng Lin, Zhiming Cui, Zhen Dong, Sai-Kit Yeung, Wenping Wang, Yuan Liu | Recent developments in monocular depth estimation methods enable high-quality depth estimation of single-view images but fail to estimate consistent video depth across different frames. Recent works address this problem by applying a video diffusion model to generate video depth conditioned on the input video, which is training-expensive and can only produce scale-invariant depth values without camera poses. In this paper, we propose a novel video-depth estimation method called Align3R to estimate temporal consistent depth maps for a dynamic video. Our key idea is to utilize the recent DUSt3R model to align estimated monocular depth maps of different timesteps. First, we fine-tune the DUSt3R model with additional estimated monocular depth as inputs for the dynamic scenes. Then, we apply optimization to reconstruct both depth maps and camera poses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Align3R estimates consistent video depth and camera poses for a monocular video with superior performance than baseline methods. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03079v2) | [https://igl-hkust.github.io/Align3R](https://igl-hkust.github.io/Align3R) |
| Efficient Diffusion as Low Light Enhancer | Guanzhou Lan, Qianli Ma, Yuqi Yang, Zhigang Wang, Dong Wang, Xuelong Li, Bin Zhao | The computational burden of the iterative sampling process remains a major challenge in diffusion-based Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE). Current acceleration methods, whether training-based or training-free, often lead to significant performance degradation, highlighting the trade-off between performance and efficiency. In this paper, we identify two primary factors contributing to performance degradation: fitting errors and the inference gap. Our key insight is that fitting errors can be mitigated by linearly extrapolating the incorrect score functions, while the inference gap can be reduced by shifting the Gaussian flow to a reflectance-aware residual space. Based on the above insights, we design Reflectance-Aware Trajectory Refinement (RATR) module, a simple yet effective module to refine the teacher trajectory using the reflectance component of images. Following this, we introduce \textbf{Re}flectance-aware \textbf{D}iffusion with \textbf{Di}stilled \textbf{T}rajectory (\textbf{ReDDiT}), an efficient and flexible distillation framework tailored for LLIE. Our framework achieves comparable performance to previous diffusion-based methods with redundant steps in just 2 steps while establishing new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results with 8 or 4 steps. Comprehensive experimental evaluations on 10 benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our method, consistently outperforming existing SOTA methods. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.12346v2) | N/A |
| RELOCATE: A Simple Training-Free Baseline for Visual Query Localization Using Region-Based Representations | Savya Khosla, Sethuraman T V, Alexander Schwing, Derek Hoiem | We present RELOCATE, a simple training-free baseline designed to perform the challenging task of visual query localization in long videos. To eliminate the need for task-specific training and efficiently handle long videos, RELOCATE leverages a region-based representation derived from pretrained vision models. At a high level, it follows the classic object localization approach: (1) identify all objects in each video frame, (2) compare the objects with the given query and select the most similar ones, and (3) perform bidirectional tracking to get a spatio-temporal response. However, we propose some key enhancements to handle small objects, cluttered scenes, partial visibility, and varying appearances. Notably, we refine the selected objects for accurate localization and generate additional visual queries to capture visual variations. We evaluate RELOCATE on the challenging Ego4D Visual Query 2D Localization dataset, establishing a new baseline that outperforms prior task-specific methods by 49% (relative improvement) in spatio-temporal average precision. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01826v1) | N/A |
| Towards Effective and Sparse Adversarial Attack on Spiking Neural Networks via Breaking Invisible Surrogate Gradients | Li Lun, Kunyu Feng, Qinglong Ni, Ling Liang, Yuan Wang, Ying Li, Dunshan Yu, Xiaoxin Cui | Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have shown their competence in handling spatial-temporal event-based data with low energy consumption. Similar to conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs), SNNs are also vulnerable to gradient-based adversarial attacks, wherein gradients are calculated by spatial-temporal back-propagation (STBP) and surrogate gradients (SGs). However, the SGs may be invisible for an inference-only model as they do not influence the inference results, and current gradient-based attacks are ineffective for binary dynamic images captured by the dynamic vision sensor (DVS). While some approaches addressed the issue of invisible SGs through universal SGs, their SGs lack a correlation with the victim model, resulting in sub-optimal performance. Moreover, the imperceptibility of existing SNN-based binary attacks is still insufficient. In this paper, we introduce an innovative potential-dependent surrogate gradient (PDSG) method to establish a robust connection between the SG and the model, thereby enhancing the adaptability of adversarial attacks across various models with invisible SGs. Additionally, we propose the sparse dynamic attack (SDA) to effectively attack binary dynamic images. Utilizing a generation-reduction paradigm, SDA can fully optimize the sparsity of adversarial perturbations. Experimental results demonstrate that our PDSG and SDA outperform state-of-the-art SNN-based attacks across various models and datasets. Specifically, our PDSG achieves 100% attack success rate on ImageNet, and our SDA obtains 82% attack success rate by modifying only 0.24% of the pixels on CIFAR10DVS. The code is available at https://github.com/ryime/PDSG-SDA . | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.03272v2) | [https://github.com/ryime/PDSG-SDA](https://github.com/ryime/PDSG-SDA) |
| RORem: Training a Robust Object Remover with Human-in-the-Loop | Ruibin Li, Tao Yang, Song Guo, Lei Zhang | Despite the significant advancements, existing object removal methods struggle with incomplete removal, incorrect content synthesis and blurry synthesized regions, resulting in low success rates. Such issues are mainly caused by the lack of high-quality paired training data, as well as the self-supervised training paradigm adopted in these methods, which forces the model to in-paint the masked regions, leading to ambiguity between synthesizing the masked objects and restoring the background. To address these issues, we propose a semi-supervised learning strategy with human-in-the-loop to create high-quality paired training data, aiming to train a Robust Object Remover (RORem). We first collect 60K training pairs from open-source datasets to train an initial object removal model for generating removal samples, and then utilize human feedback to select a set of high-quality object removal pairs, with which we train a discriminator to automate the following training data generation process. By iterating this process for several rounds, we finally obtain a substantial object removal dataset with over 200K pairs. Fine-tuning the pre-trained stable diffusion model with this dataset, we obtain our RORem, which demonstrates state-of-the-art object removal performance in terms of both reliability and image quality. Particularly, RORem improves the object removal success rate over previous methods by more than 18\%. The dataset, source code and trained model are available at https://github.com/leeruibin/RORem. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00740v2) | [https://github.com/leeruibin/RORem](https://github.com/leeruibin/RORem) |
| Object Detection using Event Camera: A MoE Heat Conduction based Detector and A New Benchmark Dataset | Xiao Wang, Yu Jin, Wentao Wu, Wei Zhang, Lin Zhu, Bo Jiang, Yonghong Tian | Object detection in event streams has emerged as a cutting-edge research area, demonstrating superior performance in low-light conditions, scenarios with motion blur, and rapid movements. Current detectors leverage spiking neural networks, Transformers, or convolutional neural networks as their core architectures, each with its own set of limitations including restricted performance, high computational overhead, or limited local receptive fields. This paper introduces a novel MoE (Mixture of Experts) heat conduction-based object detection algorithm that strikingly balances accuracy and computational efficiency. Initially, we employ a stem network for event data embedding, followed by processing through our innovative MoE-HCO blocks. Each block integrates various expert modules to mimic heat conduction within event streams. Subsequently, an IoU-based query selection module is utilized for efficient token extraction, which is then channeled into a detection head for the final object detection process. Furthermore, we are pleased to introduce EvDET200K, a novel benchmark dataset for event-based object detection. Captured with a high-definition Prophesee EVK4-HD event camera, this dataset encompasses 10 distinct categories, 200,000 bounding boxes, and 10,054 samples, each spanning 2 to 5 seconds. We also provide comprehensive results from over 15 state-of-the-art detectors, offering a solid foundation for future research and comparison.

| Gazing Into Missteps: Leveraging Eye-Gaze for Unsupervised Mistake Detection in Egocentric Videos of Skilled Human Activities | Michele Mazzamuto, Antonino Furnari, Yoichi Sato, Giovanni Maria Farinella | We address the challenge of unsupervised mistake detection in egocentric video of skilled human activities through the analysis of gaze signals. While traditional methods rely on manually labeled mistakes, our approach does not require mistake annotations, hence overcoming the need of domain-specific labeled data. Based on the observation that eye movements closely follow object manipulation activities, we assess to what extent eye-gaze signals can support mistake detection, proposing to identify deviations in attention patterns measured through a gaze tracker with respect to those estimated by a gaze prediction model. Since predicting gaze in video is characterized by high uncertainty, we propose a novel gaze completion task, where eye fixations are predicted from visual observations and partial gaze trajectories, and contribute a novel gaze completion approach which explicitly models correlations between gaze information and local visual tokens. Inconsistencies between predicted and observed gaze trajectories act as an indicator to identify mistakes. Experiments highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach in different settings, with relative gains up to +14%, +11%, and +5% in EPIC-Tent, HoloAssist and IndustReal respectively, remarkably matching results of supervised approaches without seeing any labels. We further show that gaze-based analysis is particularly useful in the presence of skilled actions, low action execution confidence, and actions requiring hand-eye coordination and object manipulation skills. Our method is ranked first on the HoloAssist Mistake Detection challenge. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.08379v4) | [https://github.com/alexandrosstergiou/TrajREC](https://github.com/alexandrosstergiou/TrajREC) |
| FINECAPTION: Compositional Image Captioning Focusing on Wherever You Want at Any Granularity | Hang Hua, Qing Liu, Lingzhi Zhang, Jing Shi, Zhifei Zhang, Yilin Wang, Jianming Zhang, Jiebo Luo | The advent of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has significantly advanced multimodal tasks, enabling more sophisticated and accurate reasoning across various applications, including image and video captioning, visual question answering, and cross-modal retrieval. Despite their superior capabilities, VLMs struggle with fine-grained image regional composition information perception. Specifically, they have difficulty accurately aligning the segmentation masks with the corresponding semantics and precisely describing the compositional aspects of the referred regions.   However, compositionality - the ability to understand and generate novel combinations of known visual and textual components - is critical for facilitating coherent reasoning and understanding across modalities by VLMs. To address this issue, we propose FINECAPTION, a novel VLM that can recognize arbitrary masks as referential inputs and process high-resolution images for compositional image captioning at different granularity levels. To support this endeavor, we introduce COMPOSITIONCAP, a new dataset for multi-grained region compositional image captioning, which introduces the task of compositional attribute-aware regional image captioning.   Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model compared to other state-of-the-art VLMs. Additionally, we analyze the capabilities of current VLMs in recognizing various visual prompts for compositional region image captioning, highlighting areas for improvement in VLM design and training. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.15411v1) | [https://hanghuacs.github.io/FineCaption](https://hanghuacs.github.io/FineCaption) |
| SF3D: Stable Fast 3D Mesh Reconstruction with UV-unwrapping and Illumination Disentanglement | Mark Boss, Zixuan Huang, Aaryaman Vasishta, Varun Jampani | We present SF3D, a novel method for rapid and high-quality textured object mesh reconstruction from a single image in just 0.5 seconds. Unlike most existing approaches, SF3D is explicitly trained for mesh generation, incorporating a fast UV unwrapping technique that enables swift texture generation rather than relying on vertex colors. The method also learns to predict material parameters and normal maps to enhance the visual quality of the reconstructed 3D meshes. Furthermore, SF3D integrates a delighting step to effectively remove low-frequency illumination effects, ensuring that the reconstructed meshes can be easily used in novel illumination conditions. Experiments demonstrate the superior performance of SF3D over the existing techniques. Project page: https://stable-fast-3d.github.io | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00653v1) | N/A |
| VLOGGER: Multimodal Diffusion for Embodied Avatar Synthesis | Enric Corona, Andrei Zanfir, Eduard Gabriel Bazavan, Nikos Kolotouros, Thiemo Alldieck, Cristian Sminchisescu | We propose VLOGGER, a method for audio-driven human video generation from a single input image of a person, which builds on the success of recent generative diffusion models. Our method consists of 1) a stochastic human-to-3d-motion diffusion model, and 2) a novel diffusion-based architecture that augments text-to-image models with both spatial and temporal controls. This supports the generation of high quality video of variable length, easily controllable through high-level representations of human faces and bodies. In contrast to previous work, our method does not require training for each person, does not rely on face detection and cropping, generates the complete image (not just the face or the lips), and considers a broad spectrum of scenarios (e.g. visible torso or diverse subject identities) that are critical to correctly synthesize humans who communicate. We also curate MENTOR, a new and diverse dataset with 3d pose and expression annotations, one order of magnitude larger than previous ones (800,000 identities) and with dynamic gestures, on which we train and ablate our main technical contributions.   VLOGGER outperforms state-of-the-art methods in three public benchmarks, considering image quality, identity preservation and temporal consistency while also generating upper-body gestures. We analyze the performance of VLOGGER with respect to multiple diversity metrics, showing that our architectural choices and the use of MENTOR benefit training a fair and unbiased model at scale. Finally we show applications in video editing and personalization. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.08764v1) | [https://enriccorona.github.io/vlogger](https://enriccorona.github.io/vlogger) |
| MAP: Unleashing Hybrid Mamba-Transformer Vision Backbone's Potential with Masked Autoregressive Pretraining | Yunze Liu, Li Yi | Mamba has achieved significant advantages in long-context modeling and autoregressive tasks, but its scalability with large parameters remains a major limitation in vision applications. pretraining is a widely used strategy to enhance backbone model performance. Although the success of Masked Autoencoder in Transformer pretraining is well recognized, it does not significantly improve Mamba's visual learning performance. We found that using the correct autoregressive pretraining can significantly boost the performance of the Mamba architecture. Based on this analysis, we propose Masked Autoregressive Pretraining (MAP) to pretrain a hybrid Mamba-Transformer vision backbone network. This strategy combines the strengths of both MAE and Autoregressive pretraining, improving the performance of Mamba and Transformer modules within a unified paradigm. Additionally, in terms of integrating Mamba and Transformer modules, we empirically found that inserting Transformer layers at regular intervals within Mamba layers can significantly enhance downstream task performance. Experimental results show that both the pure Mamba architecture and the hybrid Mamba-Transformer vision backbone network pretrained with MAP significantly outperform other pretraining strategies, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We validate the effectiveness of the method on both 2D and 3D datasets and provide detailed ablation studies to support the design choices for each component. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.00871v1) | N/A |
| DistinctAD: Distinctive Audio Description Generation in Contexts | Bo Fang, Wenhao Wu, Qiangqiang Wu, Yuxin Song, Antoni B. Chan | Audio Descriptions (ADs) aim to provide a narration of a movie in text form, describing non-dialogue-related narratives, such as characters, actions, or scene establishment. Automatic generation of ADs remains challenging due to: i) the domain gap between movie-AD data and existing data used to train vision-language models, and ii) the issue of contextual redundancy arising from highly similar neighboring visual clips in a long movie. In this work, we propose DistinctAD, a novel two-stage framework for generating ADs that emphasize distinctiveness to produce better narratives. To address the domain gap, we introduce a CLIP-AD adaptation strategy that does not require additional AD corpora, enabling more effective alignment between movie and AD modalities at both global and fine-grained levels. In Stage-II, DistinctAD incorporates two key innovations: (i) a Contextual Expectation-Maximization Attention (EMA) module that reduces redundancy by extracting common bases from consecutive video clips, and (ii) an explicit distinctive word prediction loss that filters out repeated words in the context, ensuring the prediction of unique terms specific to the current AD. Comprehensive evaluations on MAD-Eval, CMD-AD, and TV-AD benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DistinctAD, with the model consistently outperforming baselines, particularly in Recall@k/N, highlighting its effectiveness in producing high-quality, distinctive ADs. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18180v1) | N/A |
| Breaking the Low-Rank Dilemma of Linear Attention | Qihang Fan, Huaibo Huang, Ran He | The Softmax attention mechanism in Transformer models is notoriously computationally expensive, particularly due to its quadratic complexity, posing significant challenges in vision applications. In contrast, linear attention provides a far more efficient solution by reducing the complexity to linear levels. However, compared to Softmax attention, linear attention often experiences significant performance degradation. Our experiments indicate that this performance drop is due to the low-rank nature of linear attention's feature map, which hinders its ability to adequately model complex spatial information. In this paper, to break the low-rank dilemma of linear attention, we conduct rank analysis from two perspectives: the KV buffer and the output features. Consequently, we introduce Rank-Augmented Linear Attention (RALA), which rivals the performance of Softmax attention while maintaining linear complexity and high efficiency. Based on RALA, we construct the Rank-Augmented Vision Linear Transformer (RAVLT). Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAVLT achieves excellent performance across various vision tasks. Specifically, without using any additional labels, data, or supervision during training, RAVLT achieves an 84.4% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1k with only 26M parameters and 4.6G FLOPs. This result significantly surpasses previous linear attention mechanisms, fully illustrating the potential of RALA.

| PhysicsGen: Can Generative Models Learn from Images to Predict Complex Physical Relations? | Martin Spitznagel, Jan Vaillant, Janis Keuper | The image-to-image translation abilities of generative learning models have recently made significant progress in the estimation of complex (steered) mappings between image distributions. While appearance based tasks like image in-painting or style transfer have been studied at length, we propose to investigate the potential of generative models in the context of physical simulations. Providing a dataset of 300k image-pairs and baseline evaluations for three different physical simulation tasks, we propose a benchmark to investigate the following research questions: i) are generative models able to learn complex physical relations from input-output image pairs? ii) what speedups can be achieved by replacing differential equation based simulations? While baseline evaluations of different current models show the potential for high speedups (ii), these results also show strong limitations toward the physical correctness (i). This underlines the need for new methods to enforce physical correctness. Data, baseline models and evaluation code http://www.physics-gen.org. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05333v1) | N/A |
| Nonisotropic Gaussian Diffusion for Realistic 3D Human Motion Prediction | Cecilia Curreli, Dominik Muhle, Abhishek Saroha, Zhenzhang Ye, Riccardo Marin, Daniel Cremers | Probabilistic human motion prediction aims to forecast multiple possible future movements from past observations. While current approaches report high diversity and realism, they often generate motions with undetected limb stretching and jitter. To address this, we introduce SkeletonDiffusion, a latent diffusion model that embeds an explicit inductive bias on the human body within its architecture and training. Our model is trained with a novel nonisotropic Gaussian diffusion formulation that aligns with the natural kinematic structure of the human skeleton. Results show that our approach outperforms conventional isotropic alternatives, consistently generating realistic predictions while avoiding artifacts such as limb distortion. Additionally, we identify a limitation in commonly used diversity metrics, which may inadvertently favor models that produce inconsistent limb lengths within the same sequence. SkeletonDiffusion sets a new benchmark on three real-world datasets, outperforming various baselines across multiple evaluation metrics.

| Reconciling Stochastic and Deterministic Strategies for Zero-shot Image Restoration using Diffusion Model in Dual | Chong Wang, Lanqing Guo, Zixuan Fu, Siyuan Yang, Hao Cheng, Alex C. Kot, Bihan Wen | Plug-and-play (PnP) methods offer an iterative strategy for solving image restoration (IR) problems in a zero-shot manner, using a learned \textit{discriminative denoiser} as the implicit prior. More recently, a sampling-based variant of this approach, which utilizes a pre-trained \textit{generative diffusion model}, has gained great popularity for solving IR problems through stochastic sampling. The IR results using PnP with a pre-trained diffusion model demonstrate distinct advantages compared to those using discriminative denoisers, \ie improved perceptual quality while sacrificing the data fidelity. The unsatisfactory results are due to the lack of integration of these strategies in the IR tasks. In this work, we propose a novel zero-shot IR scheme, dubbed Reconciling Diffusion Model in Dual (RDMD), which leverages only a \textbf{single} pre-trained diffusion model to construct \textbf{two} complementary regularizers. Specifically, the diffusion model in RDMD will iteratively perform deterministic denoising and stochastic sampling, aiming to achieve high-fidelity image restoration with appealing perceptual quality. RDMD also allows users to customize the distortion-perception tradeoff with a single hyperparameter, enhancing the adaptability of the restoration process in different practical scenarios. Extensive experiments on several IR tasks demonstrate that our proposed method could achieve superior results compared to existing approaches on both the FFHQ and ImageNet datasets. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.01288v1) | [https://github.com/ChongWang1024/RDMD](https://github.com/ChongWang1024/RDMD) |
| Rectified Diffusion Guidance for Conditional Generation | Mengfei Xia, Nan Xue, Yujun Shen, Ran Yi, Tieliang Gong, Yong-Jin Liu | Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which combines the conditional and unconditional score functions with two coefficients summing to one, serves as a practical technique for diffusion model sampling. Theoretically, however, denoising with CFG cannot be expressed as a reciprocal diffusion process, which may consequently leave some hidden risks during use. In this work, we revisit the theory behind CFG and rigorously confirm that the improper configuration of the combination coefficients (i.e., the widely used summing-to-one version) brings about expectation shift of the generative distribution. To rectify this issue, we propose ReCFG with a relaxation on the guidance coefficients such that denoising with ReCFG strictly aligns with the diffusion theory. We further show that our approach enjoys a closed-form solution given the guidance strength. That way, the rectified coefficients can be readily pre-computed via traversing the observed data, leaving the sampling speed barely affected. Empirical evidence on real-world data demonstrate the compatibility of our post-hoc design with existing state-of-the-art diffusion models, including both class-conditioned ones (e.g., EDM2 on ImageNet) and text-conditioned ones (e.g., SD3 on CC12M), without any retraining. We will open-source the code to facilitate further research. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.18737v1) | [https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion), [https://github.com/NVlabs/edm2](https://github.com/NVlabs/edm2), [https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3-medium-diffusers](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3-medium-diffusers) |
| Aesthetic Post-Training Diffusion Models from Generic Preferences with Step-by-step Preference Optimization | Zhanhao Liang, Yuhui Yuan, Shuyang Gu, Bohan Chen, Tiankai Hang, Mingxi Cheng, Ji Li, Liang Zheng | Generating visually appealing images is fundamental to modern text-to-image generation models. A potential solution to better aesthetics is direct preference optimization (DPO), which has been applied to diffusion models to improve general image quality including prompt alignment and aesthetics. Popular DPO methods propagate preference labels from clean image pairs to all the intermediate steps along the two generation trajectories. However, preference labels provided in existing datasets are blended with layout and aesthetic opinions, which would disagree with aesthetic preference. Even if aesthetic labels were provided (at substantial cost), it would be hard for the two-trajectory methods to capture nuanced visual differences at different steps. To improve aesthetics economically, this paper uses existing generic preference data and introduces step-by-step preference optimization (SPO) that discards the propagation strategy and allows fine-grained image details to be assessed. Specifically, at each denoising step, we 1) sample a pool of candidates by denoising from a shared noise latent, 2) use a step-aware preference model to find a suitable win-lose pair to supervise the diffusion model, and 3) randomly select one from the pool to initialize the next denoising step. This strategy ensures that the diffusion models to focus on the subtle, fine-grained visual differences instead of layout aspect. We find that aesthetic can be significantly enhanced by accumulating these improved minor differences. When fine-tuning Stable Diffusion v1.5 and SDXL, SPO yields significant improvements in aesthetics compared with existing DPO methods while not sacrificing image-text alignment compared with vanilla models. Moreover, SPO converges much faster than DPO methods due to the step-by-step alignment of fine-grained visual details. Code and models are available at https://github.com/RockeyCoss/SPO. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.04314v2) | [https://github.com/RockeyCoss/SPO](https://github.com/RockeyCoss/SPO) |
| MotionBench: Benchmarking and Improving Fine-grained Video Motion Understanding for Vision Language Models | Wenyi Hong, Yean Cheng, Zhuoyi Yang, Weihan Wang, Lefan Wang, Xiaotao Gu, Shiyu Huang, Yuxiao Dong, Jie Tang | In recent years, vision language models (VLMs) have made significant advancements in video understanding. However, a crucial capability - fine-grained motion comprehension - remains under-explored in current benchmarks. To address this gap, we propose MotionBench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark designed to assess the fine-grained motion comprehension of video understanding models. MotionBench evaluates models' motion-level perception through six primary categories of motion-oriented question types and includes data collected from diverse sources, ensuring a broad representation of real-world video content. Experimental results reveal that existing VLMs perform poorly in understanding fine-grained motions. To enhance VLM's ability to perceive fine-grained motion within a limited sequence length of LLM, we conduct extensive experiments reviewing VLM architectures optimized for video feature compression and propose a novel and efficient Through-Encoder (TE) Fusion method. Experiments show that higher frame rate inputs and TE Fusion yield improvements in motion understanding, yet there is still substantial room for enhancement. Our benchmark aims to guide and motivate the development of more capable video understanding models, emphasizing the importance of fine-grained motion comprehension.

| Auto Cherry-Picker: Learning from High-quality Generative Data Driven by Language | Yicheng Chen, Xiangtai Li, Yining Li, Yanhong Zeng, Jianzong Wu, Xiangyu Zhao, Kai Chen | Diffusion models can generate realistic and diverse images, potentially facilitating data availability for data-intensive perception tasks. However, leveraging these models to boost performance on downstream tasks with synthetic data poses several challenges, including aligning with real data distribution, scaling synthetic sample volumes, and ensuring their quality. To bridge these gaps, we present \textbf{A}uto \textbf{C}herry-\textbf{P}icker (ACP), a novel framework that generates high-quality cross-modality training samples at scale to augment perception and multi-modal training. ACP first uses LLMs to sample descriptions and layouts based on object combinations from real data priors, eliminating the need for ground truth image captions or annotations. Next, we use an off-the-shelf controllable diffusion model to generate multiple images. Then, the generated data are refined using a comprehensively designed metric, Composite Layout and Image Score (CLIS), to ensure quality. Our customized synthetic high-quality samples boost performance in various scenarios, especially in addressing challenges associated with long-tailed distribution and imbalanced datasets. Experiment results on downstream tasks demonstrate that ACP can significantly improve the performance of existing models. In addition, we find a positive correlation between CLIS and performance gains in downstream tasks. This finding shows the potential for evaluation metrics as the role for various visual perception and MLLM tasks. Code will be available. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.20085v2) | [https://yichengchen24.github.io/projects](https://yichengchen24.github.io/projects) |
| Reconstructing Animals and the Wild | Peter Kulits, Michael J. Black, Silvia Zuffi | The idea of 3D reconstruction as scene understanding is foundational in computer vision. Reconstructing 3D scenes from 2D visual observations requires strong priors to disambiguate structure. Much work has been focused on the anthropocentric, which, characterized by smooth surfaces, coherent normals, and regular edges, allows for the integration of strong geometric inductive biases. Here, we consider a more challenging problem where such assumptions do not hold: the reconstruction of natural scenes containing trees, bushes, boulders, and animals. While numerous works have attempted to tackle the problem of reconstructing animals in the wild, they have focused solely on the animal, neglecting environmental context. This limits their usefulness for analysis tasks, as animals exist inherently within the 3D world, and information is lost when environmental factors are disregarded. We propose a method to reconstruct natural scenes from single images. We base our approach on recent advances leveraging the strong world priors ingrained in Large Language Models and train an autoregressive model to decode a CLIP embedding into a structured compositional scene representation, encompassing both animals and the wild (RAW). To enable this, we propose a synthetic dataset comprising one million images and thousands of assets. Our approach, having been trained solely on synthetic data, generalizes to the task of reconstructing animals and their environments in real-world images. We will release our dataset and code to encourage future research at https://raw.is.tue.mpg.de/ | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18807v1) | [https://huggingface.co/lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1](https://huggingface.co/lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1), [https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-large-](https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-large-) |
| Concept Replacer: Replacing Sensitive Concepts in Diffusion Models via Precision Localization | Lingyun Zhang, Yu Xie, Yanwei Fu, Ping Chen | As large-scale diffusion models continue to advance, they excel at producing high-quality images but often generate unwanted content, such as sexually explicit or violent content. Existing methods for concept removal generally guide the image generation process but can unintentionally modify unrelated regions, leading to inconsistencies with the original model. We propose a novel approach for targeted concept replacing in diffusion models, enabling specific concepts to be removed without affecting non-target areas. Our method introduces a dedicated concept localizer for precisely identifying the target concept during the denoising process, trained with few-shot learning to require minimal labeled data. Within the identified region, we introduce a training-free Dual Prompts Cross-Attention (DPCA) module to substitute the target concept, ensuring minimal disruption to surrounding content. We evaluate our method on concept localization precision and replacement efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior precision in localizing target concepts and performs coherent concept replacement with minimal impact on non-target areas, outperforming existing approaches. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01244v2) | N/A |
| RoboSense: Large-scale Dataset and Benchmark for Egocentric Robot Perception and Navigation in Crowded and Unstructured Environments | Haisheng Su, Feixiang Song, Cong Ma, Wei Wu, Junchi Yan | Reliable embodied perception from an egocentric perspective is challenging yet essential for autonomous navigation technology of intelligent mobile agents. With the growing demand of social robotics, near-field scene understanding becomes an important research topic in the areas of egocentric perceptual tasks related to navigation in both crowded and unstructured environments. Due to the complexity of environmental conditions and difficulty of surrounding obstacles owing to truncation and occlusion, the perception capability under this circumstance is still inferior. To further enhance the intelligence of mobile robots, in this paper, we setup an egocentric multi-sensor data collection platform based on 3 main types of sensors (Camera, LiDAR and Fisheye), which supports flexible sensor configurations to enable dynamic sight of view from ego-perspective, capturing either near or farther areas. Meanwhile, a large-scale multimodal dataset is constructed, named RoboSense, to facilitate egocentric robot perception. Specifically, RoboSense contains more than 133K synchronized data with 1.4M 3D bounding box and IDs annotated in the full $360^{\circ}$ view, forming 216K trajectories across 7.6K temporal sequences. It has $270\times$ and $18\times$ as many annotations of surrounding obstacles within near ranges as the previous datasets collected for autonomous driving scenarios such as KITTI and nuScenes. Moreover, we define a novel matching criterion for near-field 3D perception and prediction metrics. Based on RoboSense, we formulate 6 popular tasks to facilitate the future research development, where the detailed analysis as well as benchmarks are also provided accordingly. Data desensitization measures have been conducted for privacy protection. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15503v5) | N/A |
| Rethinking Diffusion for Text-Driven Human Motion Generation | Zichong Meng, Yiming Xie, Xiaogang Peng, Zeyu Han, Huaizu Jiang | Since 2023, Vector Quantization (VQ)-based discrete generation methods have rapidly dominated human motion generation, primarily surpassing diffusion-based continuous generation methods in standard performance metrics. However, VQ-based methods have inherent limitations. Representing continuous motion data as limited discrete tokens leads to inevitable information loss, reduces the diversity of generated motions, and restricts their ability to function effectively as motion priors or generation guidance. In contrast, the continuous space generation nature of diffusion-based methods makes them well-suited to address these limitations and with even potential for model scalability. In this work, we systematically investigate why current VQ-based methods perform well and explore the limitations of existing diffusion-based methods from the perspective of motion data representation and distribution. Drawing on these insights, we preserve the inherent strengths of a diffusion-based human motion generation model and gradually optimize it with inspiration from VQ-based approaches. Our approach introduces a human motion diffusion model enabled to perform bidirectional masked autoregression, optimized with a reformed data representation and distribution. Additionally, we also propose more robust evaluation methods to fairly assess different-based methods. Extensive experiments on benchmark human motion generation datasets demonstrate that our method excels previous methods and achieves state-of-the-art performances. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16575v1) | [https://neu-vi.github.io/MARDM](https://neu-vi.github.io/MARDM) |
| MaskGaussian: Adaptive 3D Gaussian Representation from Probabilistic Masks | Yifei Liu, Zhihang Zhong, Yifan Zhan, Sheng Xu, Xiao Sun | While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable performance in novel view synthesis and real-time rendering, the high memory consumption due to the use of millions of Gaussians limits its practicality. To mitigate this issue, improvements have been made by pruning unnecessary Gaussians, either through a hand-crafted criterion or by using learned masks. However, these methods deterministically remove Gaussians based on a snapshot of the pruning moment, leading to sub-optimized reconstruction performance from a long-term perspective. To address this issue, we introduce MaskGaussian, which models Gaussians as probabilistic entities rather than permanently removing them, and utilize them according to their probability of existence. To achieve this, we propose a masked-rasterization technique that enables unused yet probabilistically existing Gaussians to receive gradients, allowing for dynamic assessment of their contribution to the evolving scene and adjustment of their probability of existence. Hence, the importance of Gaussians iteratively changes and the pruned Gaussians are selected diversely. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in achieving better rendering quality with fewer Gaussians than previous pruning methods, pruning over 60% of Gaussians on average with only a 0.02 PSNR decline.

| Video Motion Transfer with Diffusion Transformers | Alexander Pondaven, Aliaksandr Siarohin, Sergey Tulyakov, Philip Torr, Fabio Pizzati | We propose DiTFlow, a method for transferring the motion of a reference video to a newly synthesized one, designed specifically for Diffusion Transformers (DiT). We first process the reference video with a pre-trained DiT to analyze cross-frame attention maps and extract a patch-wise motion signal called the Attention Motion Flow (AMF). We guide the latent denoising process in an optimization-based, training-free, manner by optimizing latents with our AMF loss to generate videos reproducing the motion of the reference one. We also apply our optimization strategy to transformer positional embeddings, granting us a boost in zero-shot motion transfer capabilities. We evaluate DiTFlow against recently published methods, outperforming all across multiple metrics and human evaluation. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07776v1) | N/A |
| Personalized Preference Fine-tuning of Diffusion Models | Meihua Dang, Anikait Singh, Linqi Zhou, Stefano Ermon, Jiaming Song | RLHF techniques like DPO can significantly improve the generation quality of text-to-image diffusion models. However, these methods optimize for a single reward that aligns model generation with population-level preferences, neglecting the nuances of individual users' beliefs or values. This lack of personalization limits the efficacy of these models. To bridge this gap, we introduce PPD, a multi-reward optimization objective that aligns diffusion models with personalized preferences. With PPD, a diffusion model learns the individual preferences of a population of users in a few-shot way, enabling generalization to unseen users. Specifically, our approach (1) leverages a vision-language model (VLM) to extract personal preference embeddings from a small set of pairwise preference examples, and then (2) incorporates the embeddings into diffusion models through cross attention. Conditioning on user embeddings, the text-to-image models are fine-tuned with the DPO objective, simultaneously optimizing for alignment with the preferences of multiple users. Empirical results demonstrate that our method effectively optimizes for multiple reward functions and can interpolate between them during inference. In real-world user scenarios, with as few as four preference examples from a new user, our approach achieves an average win rate of 76\% over Stable Cascade, generating images that more accurately reflect specific user preferences. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06655v1) | N/A |
| Learning Temporally Consistent Video Depth from Video Diffusion Priors | Jiahao Shao, Yuanbo Yang, Hongyu Zhou, Youmin Zhang, Yujun Shen, Vitor Guizilini, Yue Wang, Matteo Poggi, Yiyi Liao | This work addresses the challenge of streamed video depth estimation, which expects not only per-frame accuracy but, more importantly, cross-frame consistency. We argue that sharing contextual information between frames or clips is pivotal in fostering temporal consistency. Thus, instead of directly developing a depth estimator from scratch, we reformulate this predictive task into a conditional generation problem to provide contextual information within a clip and across clips. Specifically, we propose a consistent context-aware training and inference strategy for arbitrarily long videos to provide cross-clip context. We sample independent noise levels for each frame within a clip during training while using a sliding window strategy and initializing overlapping frames with previously predicted frames without adding noise. Moreover, we design an effective training strategy to provide context within a clip. Extensive experimental results validate our design choices and demonstrate the superiority of our approach, dubbed ChronoDepth.

| AesthetiQ: Enhancing Graphic Layout Design via Aesthetic-Aware Preference Alignment of Multi-modal Large Language Models | Sohan Patnaik, Rishabh Jain, Balaji Krishnamurthy, Mausoom Sarkar | Visual layouts are essential in graphic design fields such as advertising, posters, and web interfaces. The application of generative models for content-aware layout generation has recently gained traction. However, these models fail to understand the contextual aesthetic requirements of layout design and do not align with human-like preferences, primarily treating it as a prediction task without considering the final rendered output. To overcome these problems, we offer Aesthetic-Aware Preference Alignment(AAPA), a novel technique to train a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) for layout prediction that uses MLLM's aesthetic preferences for Direct Preference Optimization over graphic layouts. We propose a data filtering protocol utilizing our layout-quality heuristics for AAPA to ensure training happens on high-quality layouts. Additionally, we introduce a novel evaluation metric that uses another MLLM to compute the win rate of the generated layout against the ground-truth layout based on aesthetics criteria. We also demonstrate the applicability of AAPA for MLLMs of varying scales (1B to 8B parameters) and LLM families (Qwen, Phi, InternLM). By conducting thorough qualitative and quantitative analyses, we verify the efficacy of our approach on two challenging benchmarks - Crello and Webui, showcasing 17%, and 16 improvement over current State-of-The-Art methods, thereby highlighting the potential of MLLMs in aesthetic-aware layout generation. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00591v1) | N/A |
| MotionMap: Representing Multimodality in Human Pose Forecasting | Reyhaneh Hosseininejad, Megh Shukla, Saeed Saadatnejad, Mathieu Salzmann, Alexandre Alahi | Human pose forecasting is inherently multimodal since multiple futures exist for an observed pose sequence. However, evaluating multimodality is challenging since the task is ill-posed. Therefore, we first propose an alternative paradigm to make the task well-posed. Next, while state-of-the-art methods predict multimodality, this requires oversampling a large volume of predictions. This raises key questions: (1) Can we capture multimodality by efficiently sampling a smaller number of predictions? (2) Subsequently, which of the predicted futures is more likely for an observed pose sequence? We address these questions with MotionMap, a simple yet effective heatmap based representation for multimodality. We extend heatmaps to represent a spatial distribution over the space of all possible motions, where different local maxima correspond to different forecasts for a given observation. MotionMap can capture a variable number of modes per observation and provide confidence measures for different modes. Further, MotionMap allows us to introduce the notion of uncertainty and controllability over the forecasted pose sequence. Finally, MotionMap captures rare modes that are non-trivial to evaluate yet critical for safety. We support our claims through multiple qualitative and quantitative experiments using popular 3D human pose datasets: Human3.6M and AMASS, highlighting the strengths and limitations of our proposed method.

| VideoTree: Adaptive Tree-based Video Representation for LLM Reasoning on Long Videos | Ziyang Wang, Shoubin Yu, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Jaehong Yoon, Feng Cheng, Gedas Bertasius, Mohit Bansal | Long-form video understanding has been a challenging task due to the high redundancy in video data and the abundance of query-irrelevant information. To tackle this challenge, we propose VideoTree, a training-free framework which builds a query-adaptive and hierarchical video representation for LLM reasoning over long-form videos. First, VideoTree extracts query-relevant information from the input video through an iterative process, progressively refining the selection of keyframes based on their relevance to the query. Furthermore, VideoTree leverages the inherent hierarchical structure of long video data, which is often overlooked by existing LLM-based methods. Specifically, we incorporate multigranularity information into a tree-based representation, allowing VideoTree to extract query-relevant details from long videos in a coarse-to-fine manner. This enables the model to effectively handle a wide range of video queries with varying levels of detail. Finally, VideoTree aggregates the hierarchical query-relevant information within the tree structure and feeds it into an LLM reasoning model to answer the query. Our experiments show that our training-free method improves both reasoning accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods. Specifically, VideoTree outperforms the existing training-free approaches on the popular EgoSchema and NExT-QA benchmarks with less inference time, achieving 61.1% and 75.6% accuracy on the test set without additional video-specific training. Moreover, on the long split of Video-MME benchmark (average 44 minutes), the training-free VideoTree framework achieves better performance than the strong proprietary GPT-4V model and other MLLMs that were extensively trained on video data. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.19209v2) | [https://llava-vl.github.io/blog](https://llava-vl.github.io/blog) |
| MeGA: Hybrid Mesh-Gaussian Head Avatar for High-Fidelity Rendering and Head Editing | Cong Wang, Di Kang, He-Yi Sun, Shen-Han Qian, Zi-Xuan Wang, Linchao Bao, Song-Hai Zhang | Creating high-fidelity head avatars from multi-view videos is a core issue for many AR/VR applications. However, existing methods usually struggle to obtain high-quality renderings for all different head components simultaneously since they use one single representation to model components with drastically different characteristics (e.g., skin vs. hair). In this paper, we propose a Hybrid Mesh-Gaussian Head Avatar (MeGA) that models different head components with more suitable representations. Specifically, we select an enhanced FLAME mesh as our facial representation and predict a UV displacement map to provide per-vertex offsets for improved personalized geometric details. To achieve photorealistic renderings, we obtain facial colors using deferred neural rendering and disentangle neural textures into three meaningful parts. For hair modeling, we first build a static canonical hair using 3D Gaussian Splatting. A rigid transformation and an MLP-based deformation field are further applied to handle complex dynamic expressions. Combined with our occlusion-aware blending, MeGA generates higher-fidelity renderings for the whole head and naturally supports more downstream tasks. Experiments on the NeRSemble dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our designs, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods and supporting various editing functionalities, including hairstyle alteration and texture editing. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.19026v1) | N/A |
| A Stitch in Time Saves Nine: Small VLM is a Precise Guidance for Accelerating Large VLMs | Wangbo Zhao, Yizeng Han, Jiasheng Tang, Zhikai Li, Yibing Song, Kai Wang, Zhangyang Wang, Yang You | Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable success across various multi-modal tasks, yet large VLMs encounter significant efficiency challenges due to processing numerous visual tokens. A promising approach to accelerating large VLM inference is using partial information, such as attention maps from specific layers, to assess token importance and prune less essential tokens. However, our study reveals three key insights: (i) Partial attention information is insufficient for accurately identifying critical visual tokens, resulting in suboptimal performance, especially at low token retention ratios; (ii) Global attention information, such as the attention map aggregated across all layers, more effectively preserves essential tokens and maintains comparable performance under aggressive pruning. However, the attention maps from all layers requires a full inference pass, which increases computational load and is therefore impractical in existing methods; and (iii) The global attention map aggregated from a small VLM closely resembles that of a large VLM, suggesting an efficient alternative. Based on these findings, we introduce a \textbf{training-free} method, \underline{\textbf{S}}mall VLM \underline{\textbf{G}}uidance for accelerating \underline{\textbf{L}}arge VLMs (\textbf{SGL}). Specifically, we employ the attention map aggregated from a small VLM to guide visual token pruning in a large VLM. Additionally, an early exiting mechanism is developed to fully use the small VLM's predictions, dynamically invoking the larger VLM only when necessary, yielding a superior trade-off between accuracy and computation. Extensive evaluations across 11 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of SGL, achieving up to 91\% pruning ratio for visual tokens while retaining competitive performance. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03324v2) | [https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/SGL](https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/SGL) |
| DiC: Rethinking Conv3x3 Designs in Diffusion Models | Yuchuan Tian, Jing Han, Chengcheng Wang, Yuchen Liang, Chao Xu, Hanting Chen | Diffusion models have shown exceptional performance in visual generation tasks. Recently, these models have shifted from traditional U-Shaped CNN-Attention hybrid structures to fully transformer-based isotropic architectures. While these transformers exhibit strong scalability and performance, their reliance on complicated self-attention operation results in slow inference speeds. Contrary to these works, we rethink one of the simplest yet fastest module in deep learning, 3x3 Convolution, to construct a scaled-up purely convolutional diffusion model. We first discover that an Encoder-Decoder Hourglass design outperforms scalable isotropic architectures for Conv3x3, but still under-performing our expectation. Further improving the architecture, we introduce sparse skip connections to reduce redundancy and improve scalability. Based on the architecture, we introduce conditioning improvements including stage-specific embeddings, mid-block condition injection, and conditional gating. These improvements lead to our proposed Diffusion CNN (DiC), which serves as a swift yet competitive diffusion architecture baseline. Experiments on various scales and settings show that DiC surpasses existing diffusion transformers by considerable margins in terms of performance while keeping a good speed advantage.

Existing solutions often vary by tasks, yet share fundamental principles: preserving consistency between inputs and outputs while capturing visual variations. Inspired by recent video generation models that effectively balance consistency and variation across frames, we propose a unifying approach that treats image-level tasks as discontinuous video generation. Specifically, we treat varying numbers of input and output images as frames, enabling seamless support for tasks such as image generation, editing, customization, composition, etc. Although designed for image-level tasks, we leverage videos as a scalable source for universal supervision. UniReal learns world dynamics from large-scale videos, demonstrating advanced capability in handling shadows, reflections, pose variation, and object interaction, while also exhibiting emergent capability for novel applications. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07774v2) | [https://github.com/hpcaitech/Open-](https://github.com/hpcaitech/Open-) |
| Towards Practical Real-Time Neural Video Compression | Zhaoyang Jia, Bin Li, Jiahao Li, Wenxuan Xie, Linfeng Qi, Houqiang Li, Yan Lu | We introduce a practical real-time neural video codec (NVC) designed to deliver high compression ratio, low latency and broad versatility. In practice, the coding speed of NVCs depends on 1) computational costs, and 2) non-computational operational costs, such as memory I/O and the number of function calls. While most efficient NVCs prioritize reducing computational cost, we identify operational cost as the primary bottleneck to achieving higher coding speed. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a set of efficiency-driven design improvements focused on minimizing operational costs. Specifically, we employ implicit temporal modeling to eliminate complex explicit motion modules, and use single low-resolution latent representations rather than progressive downsampling. These innovations significantly accelerate NVC without sacrificing compression quality. Additionally, we implement model integerization for consistent cross-device coding and a module-bank-based rate control scheme to improve practical adaptability. Experiments show our proposed DCVC-RT achieves an impressive average encoding/decoding speed at 125.2/112.8 fps (frames per second) for 1080p video, while saving an average of 21% in bitrate compared to H.266/VTM.

| Stealthy Backdoor Attack in Self-Supervised Learning Vision Encoders for Large Vision Language Models | Zhaoyi Liu, Huan Zhang | Self-supervised learning (SSL) vision encoders learn high-quality image representations and thus have become a vital part of developing vision modality of large vision language models (LVLMs). Due to the high cost of training such encoders, pre-trained encoders are widely shared and deployed into many LVLMs, which are security-critical or bear societal significance. Under this practical scenario, we reveal a new backdoor threat that significant visual hallucinations can be induced into these LVLMs by merely compromising vision encoders. Because of the sharing and reuse of these encoders, many downstream LVLMs may inherit backdoor behaviors from encoders, leading to widespread backdoors. In this work, we propose BadVision, the first method to exploit this vulnerability in SSL vision encoders for LVLMs with novel trigger optimization and backdoor learning techniques. We evaluate BadVision on two types of SSL encoders and LVLMs across eight benchmarks. We show that BadVision effectively drives the LVLMs to attacker-chosen hallucination with over 99% attack success rate, causing a 77.6% relative visual understanding error while maintaining the stealthiness. SoTA backdoor detection methods cannot detect our attack effectively. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.18290v2) | N/A |
| BimArt: A Unified Approach for the Synthesis of 3D Bimanual Interaction with Articulated Objects | Wanyue Zhang, Rishabh Dabral, Vladislav Golyanik, Vasileios Choutas, Eduardo Alvarado, Thabo Beeler, Marc Habermann, Christian Theobalt | We present BimArt, a novel generative approach for synthesizing 3D bimanual hand interactions with articulated objects. Unlike prior works, we do not rely on a reference grasp, a coarse hand trajectory, or separate modes for grasping and articulating. To achieve this, we first generate distance-based contact maps conditioned on the object trajectory with an articulation-aware feature representation, revealing rich bimanual patterns for manipulation. The learned contact prior is then used to guide our hand motion generator, producing diverse and realistic bimanual motions for object movement and articulation. Our work offers key insights into feature representation and contact prior for articulated objects, demonstrating their effectiveness in taming the complex, high-dimensional space of bimanual hand-object interactions. Through comprehensive quantitative experiments, we demonstrate a clear step towards simplified and high-quality hand-object animations that excel over the state-of-the-art in motion quality and diversity. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05066v1) | N/A |
| Octopus: Alleviating Hallucination via Dynamic Contrastive Decoding | Wei Suo, Lijun Zhang, Mengyang Sun, Lin Yuanbo Wu, Peng Wang, Yanning Zhang | Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have obtained impressive performance in visual content understanding and multi-modal reasoning. Unfortunately, these large models suffer from serious hallucination problems and tend to generate fabricated responses. Recently, several Contrastive Decoding (CD) strategies have been proposed to alleviate hallucination by introducing disturbed inputs. Although great progress has been made, these CD strategies mostly apply a one-size-fits-all approach for all input conditions. In this paper, we revisit this process through extensive experiments. Related results show that hallucination causes are hybrid and each generative step faces a unique hallucination challenge. Leveraging these meaningful insights, we introduce a simple yet effective Octopus-like framework that enables the model to adaptively identify hallucination types and create a dynamic CD workflow. Our Octopus framework not only outperforms existing methods across four benchmarks but also demonstrates excellent deployability and expansibility. Code is available at https://github.com/LijunZhang01/Octopus. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00361v1) | [https://github.com/LijunZhang01/Octopus](https://github.com/LijunZhang01/Octopus) |
| OverLoCK: An Overview-first-Look-Closely-next ConvNet with Context-Mixing Dynamic Kernels | Meng Lou, Yizhou Yu | In the human vision system, top-down attention plays a crucial role in perception, wherein the brain initially performs an overall but rough scene analysis to extract salient cues (i.e., overview first), followed by a finer-grained examination to make more accurate judgments (i.e., look closely next). However, recent efforts in ConvNet designs primarily focused on increasing kernel size to obtain a larger receptive field without considering this crucial biomimetic mechanism to further improve performance. To this end, we propose a novel pure ConvNet vision backbone, termed OverLoCK, which is carefully devised from both the architecture and mixer perspectives. Specifically, we introduce a biomimetic Deep-stage Decomposition Strategy (DDS) that fuses semantically meaningful context representations into middle and deep layers by providing dynamic top-down context guidance at both feature and kernel weight levels. To fully unleash the power of top-down context guidance, we further propose a novel \textbf{Cont}ext-\textbf{Mix}ing Dynamic Convolution (ContMix) that effectively models long-range dependencies while preserving inherent local inductive biases even when the input resolution increases. These properties are absent in previous convolutions. With the support from both DDS and ContMix, our OverLoCK exhibits notable performance improvement over existing methods. For instance, OverLoCK-T achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 84.2\%, significantly surpassing ConvNeXt-B while only using around one-third of the FLOPs/parameters. On object detection with Cascade Mask R-CNN, our OverLoCK-S surpasses MogaNet-B by a significant 1\% in AP$^b$. On semantic segmentation with UperNet, our OverLoCK-T remarkably improves UniRepLKNet-T by 1.7\% in mIoU.

| Enhancing SAM with Efficient Prompting and Preference Optimization for Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation | Aishik Konwer, Zhijian Yang, Erhan Bas, Cao Xiao, Prateek Prasanna, Parminder Bhatia, Taha Kass-Hout | Foundational models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) are gaining traction in medical imaging segmentation, supporting multiple downstream tasks. However, such models are supervised in nature, still relying on large annotated datasets or prompts supplied by experts. Conventional techniques such as active learning to alleviate such limitations are limited in scope and still necessitate continuous human involvement and complex domain knowledge for label refinement or establishing reward ground truth. To address these challenges, we propose an enhanced Segment Anything Model (SAM) framework that utilizes annotation-efficient prompts generated in a fully unsupervised fashion, while still capturing essential semantic, location, and shape information through contrastive language-image pretraining and visual question answering. We adopt the direct preference optimization technique to design an optimal policy that enables the model to generate high-fidelity segmentations with simple ratings or rankings provided by a virtual annotator simulating the human annotation process. State-of-the-art performance of our framework in tasks such as lung segmentation, breast tumor segmentation, and organ segmentation across various modalities, including X-ray, ultrasound, and abdominal CT, justifies its effectiveness in low-annotation data scenarios. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04639v1) | N/A |
| ReWind: Understanding Long Videos with Instructed Learnable Memory | Anxhelo Diko, Tinghuai Wang, Wassim Swaileh, Shiyan Sun, Ioannis Patras | Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are crucial for applications requiring integrated understanding textual and visual information. However, existing VLMs struggle with long videos due to computational inefficiency, memory limitations, and difficulties in maintaining coherent understanding across extended sequences. To address these challenges, we introduce ReWind, a novel memory-based VLM designed for efficient long video understanding while preserving temporal fidelity. ReWind operates in a two-stage framework. In the first stage, ReWind maintains a dynamic learnable memory module with a novel \textbf{read-perceive-write} cycle that stores and updates instruction-relevant visual information as the video unfolds. This module utilizes learnable queries and cross-attentions between memory contents and the input stream, ensuring low memory requirements by scaling linearly with the number of tokens. In the second stage, we propose an adaptive frame selection mechanism guided by the memory content to identify instruction-relevant key moments. It enriches the memory representations with detailed spatial information by selecting a few high-resolution frames, which are then combined with the memory contents and fed into a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate the final answer. We empirically demonstrate ReWind's superior performance in visual question answering (VQA) and temporal grounding tasks, surpassing previous methods on long video benchmarks. Notably, ReWind achieves a +13\% score gain and a +12\% accuracy improvement on the MovieChat-1K VQA dataset and an +8\% mIoU increase on Charades-STA for temporal grounding. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.15556v1) | [https://huggingface.co/google-bert/bert-base-uncased](https://huggingface.co/google-bert/bert-base-uncased), [https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf) |
| Towards Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection and Reasoning with Multimodal Large Language Models | Jiacong Xu, Shao-Yuan Lo, Bardia Safaei, Vishal M. Patel, Isht Dwivedi | Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) is an emerging AD paradigm. Unlike the traditional unsupervised AD setting that requires a large number of normal samples to train a model, ZSAD is more practical for handling data-restricted real-world scenarios. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown revolutionary reasoning capabilities in various vision tasks. However, the reasoning of image abnormalities remains underexplored due to the lack of corresponding datasets and benchmarks. To facilitate research in AD & reasoning, we establish the first visual instruction tuning dataset, Anomaly-Instruct-125k, and the evaluation benchmark, VisA-D&R. Through investigation with our benchmark, we reveal that current MLLMs like GPT-4o cannot accurately detect and describe fine-grained anomalous details in images. To address this, we propose Anomaly-OneVision (Anomaly-OV), the first specialist visual assistant for ZSAD and reasoning. Inspired by human behavior in visual inspection, Anomaly-OV leverages a Look-Twice Feature Matching (LTFM) mechanism to adaptively select and emphasize abnormal visual tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Anomaly-OV achieves significant improvements over advanced generalist models in both detection and reasoning. Extensions to medical and 3D AD are provided for future study.

| Balanced Rate-Distortion Optimization in Learned Image Compression | Yichi Zhang, Zhihao Duan, Yuning Huang, Fengqing Zhu | Learned image compression (LIC) using deep learning architectures has seen significant advancements, yet standard rate-distortion (R-D) optimization often encounters imbalanced updates due to diverse gradients of the rate and distortion objectives. This imbalance can lead to suboptimal optimization, where one objective dominates, thereby reducing overall compression efficiency. To address this challenge, we reformulate R-D optimization as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem and introduce two balanced R-D optimization strategies that adaptively adjust gradient updates to achieve more equitable improvements in both rate and distortion. The first proposed strategy utilizes a coarse-to-fine gradient descent approach along standard R-D optimization trajectories, making it particularly suitable for training LIC models from scratch. The second proposed strategy analytically addresses the reformulated optimization as a quadratic programming problem with an equality constraint, which is ideal for fine-tuning existing models. Experimental results demonstrate that both proposed methods enhance the R-D performance of LIC models, achieving around a 2\% BD-Rate reduction with acceptable additional training cost, leading to a more balanced and efficient optimization process. The code will be made publicly available. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.20161v1) | N/A |
| Joint Vision-Language Social Bias Removal for CLIP | Haoyu Zhang, Yangyang Guo, Mohan Kankanhalli | Vision-Language (V-L) pre-trained models such as CLIP show prominent capabilities in various downstream tasks. Despite this promise, V-L models are notoriously limited by their inherent social biases. A typical demonstration is that V-L models often produce biased predictions against specific groups of people, significantly undermining their real-world applicability. Existing approaches endeavor to mitigate the social bias problem in V-L models by removing biased attribute information from model embeddings. However, after our revisiting of these methods, we find that their bias removal is frequently accompanied by greatly compromised V-L alignment capabilities. We then reveal that this performance degradation stems from the unbalanced debiasing in image and text embeddings. To address this issue, we propose a novel V-L debiasing framework to align image and text biases followed by removing them from both modalities. By doing so, our method achieves multi-modal bias mitigation while maintaining the V-L alignment in the debiased embeddings. Additionally, we advocate a new evaluation protocol that can 1) holistically quantify the model debiasing and V-L alignment ability, and 2) evaluate the generalization of social bias removal models. We believe this work will offer new insights and guidance for future studies addressing the social bias problem in CLIP. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.12785v1) | N/A |
| Deep Change Monitoring: A Hyperbolic Representative Learning Framework and a Dataset for Long-term Fine-grained Tree Change Detection | Yante Li, Hanwen Qi, Haoyu Chen, Xinlian Liang, Guoying Zhao | In environmental protection, tree monitoring plays an essential role in maintaining and improving ecosystem health. However, precise monitoring is challenging because existing datasets fail to capture continuous fine-grained changes in trees due to low-resolution images and high acquisition costs. In this paper, we introduce UAVTC, a large-scale, long-term, high-resolution dataset collected using UAVs equipped with cameras, specifically designed to detect individual Tree Changes (TCs). UAVTC includes rich annotations and statistics based on biological knowledge, offering a fine-grained view for tree monitoring. To address environmental influences and effectively model the hierarchical diversity of physiological TCs, we propose a novel Hyperbolic Siamese Network (HSN) for TC detection, enabling compact and hierarchical representations of dynamic tree changes.   Extensive experiments show that HSN can effectively capture complex hierarchical changes and provide a robust solution for fine-grained TC detection. In addition, HSN generalizes well to cross-domain face anti-spoofing task, highlighting its broader significance in AI. We believe our work, combining ecological insights and interdisciplinary expertise, will benefit the community by offering a new benchmark and innovative AI technologies. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00643v1) | [https://github.com/liyantett/Tree-Changes-](https://github.com/liyantett/Tree-Changes-) |
| IRIS: Inverse Rendering of Indoor Scenes from Low Dynamic Range Images | Chih-Hao Lin, Jia-Bin Huang, Zhengqin Li, Zhao Dong, Christian Richardt, Tuotuo Li, Michael Zollhöfer, Johannes Kopf, Shenlong Wang, Changil Kim | Inverse rendering seeks to recover 3D geometry, surface material, and lighting from captured images, enabling advanced applications such as novel-view synthesis, relighting, and virtual object insertion. However, most existing techniques rely on high dynamic range (HDR) images as input, limiting accessibility for general users. In response, we introduce IRIS, an inverse rendering framework that recovers the physically based material, spatially-varying HDR lighting, and camera response functions from multi-view, low-dynamic-range (LDR) images. By eliminating the dependence on HDR input, we make inverse rendering technology more accessible. We evaluate our approach on real-world and synthetic scenes and compare it with state-of-the-art methods. Our results show that IRIS effectively recovers HDR lighting, accurate material, and plausible camera response functions, supporting photorealistic relighting and object insertion. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12977v2) | N/A |
| Beyond Local Sharpness: Communication-Efficient Global Sharpness-aware Minimization for Federated Learning | Debora Caldarola, Pietro Cagnasso, Barbara Caputo, Marco Ciccone | Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training with privacy preservation. Data heterogeneity across edge devices (clients) can cause models to converge to sharp minima, negatively impacting generalization and robustness. Recent approaches use client-side sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) to encourage flatter minima, but the discrepancy between local and global loss landscapes often undermines their effectiveness, as optimizing for local sharpness does not ensure global flatness. This work introduces FedGloSS (Federated Global Server-side Sharpness), a novel FL approach that prioritizes the optimization of global sharpness on the server, using SAM. To reduce communication overhead, FedGloSS cleverly approximates sharpness using the previous global gradient, eliminating the need for additional client communication. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that FedGloSS consistently reaches flatter minima and better performance compared to state-of-the-art FL methods across various federated vision benchmarks. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03752v1) | N/A |
| Effective SAM Combination for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation | Minhyeok Lee, Suhwan Cho, Jungho Lee, Sunghun Yang, Heeseung Choi, Ig-Jae Kim, Sangyoun Lee | Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation aims to assign pixel-level labels to images across an unlimited range of classes. Traditional methods address this by sequentially connecting a powerful mask proposal generator, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), with a pre-trained vision-language model like CLIP. But these two-stage approaches often suffer from high computational costs, memory inefficiencies. In this paper, we propose ESC-Net, a novel one-stage open-vocabulary segmentation model that leverages the SAM decoder blocks for class-agnostic segmentation within an efficient inference framework. By embedding pseudo prompts generated from image-text correlations into SAM's promptable segmentation framework, ESC-Net achieves refined spatial aggregation for accurate mask predictions. ESC-Net achieves superior performance on standard benchmarks, including ADE20K, PASCAL-VOC, and PASCAL-Context, outperforming prior methods in both efficiency and accuracy. Comprehensive ablation studies further demonstrate its robustness across challenging conditions. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.14723v1) | N/A |
| SleeperMark: Towards Robust Watermark against Fine-Tuning Text-to-image Diffusion Models | Zilan Wang, Junfeng Guo, Jiacheng Zhu, Yiming Li, Heng Huang, Muhao Chen, Zhengzhong Tu | Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled a variety of downstream applications, including style customization, subject-driven personalization, and conditional generation. As T2I models require extensive data and computational resources for training, they constitute highly valued intellectual property (IP) for their legitimate owners, yet making them incentive targets for unauthorized fine-tuning by adversaries seeking to leverage these models for customized, usually profitable applications. Existing IP protection methods for diffusion models generally involve embedding watermark patterns and then verifying ownership through generated outputs examination, or inspecting the model's feature space. However, these techniques are inherently ineffective in practical scenarios when the watermarked model undergoes fine-tuning, and the feature space is inaccessible during verification ((i.e., black-box setting). The model is prone to forgetting the previously learned watermark knowledge when it adapts to a new task. To address this challenge, we propose SleeperMark, a novel framework designed to embed resilient watermarks into T2I diffusion models. SleeperMark explicitly guides the model to disentangle the watermark information from the semantic concepts it learns, allowing the model to retain the embedded watermark while continuing to be fine-tuned to new downstream tasks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SleeperMark across various types of diffusion models, including latent diffusion models (e.g., Stable Diffusion) and pixel diffusion models (e.g., DeepFloyd-IF), showing robustness against downstream fine-tuning and various attacks at both the image and model levels, with minimal impact on the model's generative capability.

| Depth Any Camera: Zero-Shot Metric Depth Estimation from Any Camera | Yuliang Guo, Sparsh Garg, S. Mahdi H. Miangoleh, Xinyu Huang, Liu Ren | While recent depth estimation methods exhibit strong zero-shot generalization, achieving accurate metric depth across diverse camera types-particularly those with large fields of view (FoV) such as fisheye and 360-degree cameras-remains a significant challenge. This paper presents Depth Any Camera (DAC), a powerful zero-shot metric depth estimation framework that extends a perspective-trained model to effectively handle cameras with varying FoVs. The framework is designed to ensure that all existing 3D data can be leveraged, regardless of the specific camera types used in new applications. Remarkably, DAC is trained exclusively on perspective images but generalizes seamlessly to fisheye and 360-degree cameras without the need for specialized training data. DAC employs Equi-Rectangular Projection (ERP) as a unified image representation, enabling consistent processing of images with diverse FoVs. Its key components include a pitch-aware Image-to-ERP conversion for efficient online augmentation in ERP space, a FoV alignment operation to support effective training across a wide range of FoVs, and multi-resolution data augmentation to address resolution disparities between training and testing. DAC achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot metric depth estimation, improving delta-1 ($\delta_1$) accuracy by up to 50% on multiple fisheye and 360-degree datasets compared to prior metric depth foundation models, demonstrating robust generalization across camera types. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02464v1) | [https://yuliangguo.github.io/depth-any-camera](https://yuliangguo.github.io/depth-any-camera) |

| Optimizing for the Shortest Path in Denoising Diffusion Model | Ping Chen, Xingpeng Zhang, Zhaoxiang Liu, Huan Hu, Xiang Liu, Kai Wang, Min Wang, Yanlin Qian, Shiguo Lian | In this research, we propose a novel denoising diffusion model based on shortest-path modeling that optimizes residual propagation to enhance both denoising efficiency and quality. Drawing on Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) and insights from graph theory, our model, termed the Shortest Path Diffusion Model (ShortDF), treats the denoising process as a shortest-path problem aimed at minimizing reconstruction error. By optimizing the initial residuals, we improve the efficiency of the reverse diffusion process and the quality of the generated samples. Extensive experiments on multiple standard benchmarks demonstrate that ShortDF significantly reduces diffusion time (or steps) while enhancing the visual fidelity of generated samples compared to prior arts. This work, we suppose, paves the way for interactive diffusion-based applications and establishes a foundation for rapid data generation.

However, existing methods predominantly focus on sparse voxel representation, overlooking the complementary attributes provided by other LiDAR representations. In this work, we propose LiMoE, a framework that integrates the Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm into LiDAR data representation learning to synergistically combine multiple representations, such as range images, sparse voxels, and raw points. Our approach consists of three stages: i) Image-to-LiDAR Pretraining, which transfers prior knowledge from images to point clouds across different representations; ii) Contrastive Mixture Learning (CML), which uses MoE to adaptively activate relevant attributes from each representation and distills these mixed features into a unified 3D network; iii) Semantic Mixture Supervision (SMS), which combines semantic logits from multiple representations to boost downstream segmentation performance. Extensive experiments across 11 large-scale LiDAR datasets demonstrate our effectiveness and superiority. The code and model checkpoints have been made publicly accessible. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.04004v1) | [https://github.com/Xiangxu-0103/LiMoE](https://github.com/Xiangxu-0103/LiMoE), [https://github.com/subake/DAPS3D](https://github.com/subake/DAPS3D), [https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection), [https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection3d](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection3d), [https://github.com/ouenal/scribblekitti](https://github.com/ouenal/scribblekitti), [https://github.com/unmannedlab/RELLIS-3D](https://github.com/unmannedlab/RELLIS-3D), [https://github.com/xiaoaoran/SemanticSTF](https://github.com/xiaoaoran/SemanticSTF), [https://github.com/xiaoaoran/SynLiDAR](https://github.com/xiaoaoran/SynLiDAR), [https://github.com/subake/DAPS3D](https://github.com/subake/DAPS3D), [https://github.com/saltoricristiano/gipso-](https://github.com/saltoricristiano/gipso-), [https://github.com/ldkong1205/Robo3D](https://github.com/ldkong1205/Robo3D), [https://github.com/nutonomy/nuscenes-devkit](https://github.com/nutonomy/nuscenes-devkit), [https://github.com/PRBonn/semantic-kitti-api](https://github.com/PRBonn/semantic-kitti-api), [https://github.com/waymo-research/waymo-open-](https://github.com/waymo-research/waymo-open-), [https://github.com/valeoai/SLidR](https://github.com/valeoai/SLidR), [https://github.com/Xiangxu-0103/SuperFlow](https://github.com/Xiangxu-0103/SuperFlow), [https://github.com/Xiangxu-0103/FRNet](https://github.com/Xiangxu-0103/FRNet), [https://github.com/facebookresearch/dinov2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/dinov2), [https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmengine](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmengine), [https://github.com/mit-han-lab/torchsparse](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/torchsparse), [https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv), [https://github.com/autogluon/autogluon](https://github.com/autogluon/autogluon), [https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmpretrain](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmpretrain), [https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/MoE-LLaVA](https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/MoE-LLaVA) |
| SplineGS: Robust Motion-Adaptive Spline for Real-Time Dynamic 3D Gaussians from Monocular Video | Jongmin Park, Minh-Quan Viet Bui, Juan Luis Gonzalez Bello, Jaeho Moon, Jihyong Oh, Munchurl Kim | Synthesizing novel views from in-the-wild monocular videos is challenging due to scene dynamics and the lack of multi-view cues. To address this, we propose SplineGS, a COLMAP-free dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework for high-quality reconstruction and fast rendering from monocular videos. At its core is a novel Motion-Adaptive Spline (MAS) method, which represents continuous dynamic 3D Gaussian trajectories using cubic Hermite splines with a small number of control points. For MAS, we introduce a Motion-Adaptive Control points Pruning (MACP) method to model the deformation of each dynamic 3D Gaussian across varying motions, progressively pruning control points while maintaining dynamic modeling integrity. Additionally, we present a joint optimization strategy for camera parameter estimation and 3D Gaussian attributes, leveraging photometric and geometric consistency. This eliminates the need for Structure-from-Motion preprocessing and enhances SplineGS's robustness in real-world conditions. Experiments show that SplineGS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in novel view synthesis quality for dynamic scenes from monocular videos, achieving thousands times faster rendering speed. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09982v2) | [https://kaist-viclab.github.io/splinegs-site](https://kaist-viclab.github.io/splinegs-site) |
| One is Plenty: A Polymorphic Feature Interpreter for Immutable Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception | Yuchen Xia, Quan Yuan, Guiyang Luo, Xiaoyuan Fu, Yang Li, Xuanhan Zhu, Tianyou Luo, Siheng Chen, Jinglin Li | Collaborative perception in autonomous driving significantly enhances the perception capabilities of individual agents. Immutable heterogeneity in collaborative perception, where agents have different and fixed perception networks, presents a major challenge due to the semantic gap in their exchanged intermediate features without modifying the perception networks. Most existing methods bridge the semantic gap through interpreters. However, they either require training a new interpreter for each new agent type, limiting extensibility, or rely on a two-stage interpretation via an intermediate standardized semantic space, causing cumulative semantic loss. To achieve both extensibility in immutable heterogeneous scenarios and low-loss feature interpretation, we propose PolyInter, a polymorphic feature interpreter. It contains an extension point through which emerging new agents can seamlessly integrate by overriding only their specific prompts, which are learnable parameters intended to guide the interpretation, while reusing PolyInter's remaining parameters. By leveraging polymorphism, our design ensures that a single interpreter is sufficient to accommodate diverse agents and interpret their features into the ego agent's semantic space. Experiments conducted on the OPV2V dataset demonstrate that PolyInter improves collaborative perception precision by up to 11.1% compared to SOTA interpreters, while comparable results can be achieved by training only 1.4% of PolyInter's parameters when adapting to new agents. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16799v1) | N/A |
| Steering Away from Harm: An Adaptive Approach to Defending Vision Language Model Against Jailbreaks | Han Wang, Gang Wang, Huan Zhang | Vision Language Models (VLMs) can produce unintended and harmful content when exposed to adversarial attacks, particularly because their vision capabilities create new vulnerabilities. Existing defenses, such as input preprocessing, adversarial training, and response evaluation-based methods, are often impractical for real-world deployment due to their high costs. To address this challenge, we propose ASTRA, an efficient and effective defense by adaptively steering models away from adversarial feature directions to resist VLM attacks. Our key procedures involve finding transferable steering vectors representing the direction of harmful response and applying adaptive activation steering to remove these directions at inference time. To create effective steering vectors, we randomly ablate the visual tokens from the adversarial images and identify those most strongly associated with jailbreaks. These tokens are then used to construct steering vectors. During inference, we perform the adaptive steering method that involves the projection between the steering vectors and calibrated activation, resulting in little performance drops on benign inputs while strongly avoiding harmful outputs under adversarial inputs. Extensive experiments across multiple models and baselines demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance and high efficiency in mitigating jailbreak risks. Additionally, ASTRA exhibits good transferability, defending against both unseen attacks at design time (i.e., structured-based attacks) and adversarial images from diverse distributions. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16721v2) | [https://github.com/unitaryai/detoxify](https://github.com/unitaryai/detoxify) |
| UniGraspTransformer: Simplified Policy Distillation for Scalable Dexterous Robotic Grasping | Wenbo Wang, Fangyun Wei, Lei Zhou, Xi Chen, Lin Luo, Xiaohan Yi, Yizhong Zhang, Yaobo Liang, Chang Xu, Yan Lu, Jiaolong Yang, Baining Guo | We introduce UniGraspTransformer, a universal Transformer-based network for dexterous robotic grasping that simplifies training while enhancing scalability and performance. Unlike prior methods such as UniDexGrasp++, which require complex, multi-step training pipelines, UniGraspTransformer follows a streamlined process: first, dedicated policy networks are trained for individual objects using reinforcement learning to generate successful grasp trajectories; then, these trajectories are distilled into a single, universal network. Our approach enables UniGraspTransformer to scale effectively, incorporating up to 12 self-attention blocks for handling thousands of objects with diverse poses. Additionally, it generalizes well to both idealized and real-world inputs, evaluated in state-based and vision-based settings. Notably, UniGraspTransformer generates a broader range of grasping poses for objects in various shapes and orientations, resulting in more diverse grasp strategies. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art, UniDexGrasp++, across various object categories, achieving success rate gains of 3.5%, 7.7%, and 10.1% on seen objects, unseen objects within seen categories, and completely unseen objects, respectively, in the vision-based setting.

| Preserve or Modify? Context-Aware Evaluation for Balancing Preservation and Modification in Text-Guided Image Editing | Yoonjeon Kim, Soohyun Ryu, Yeonsung Jung, Hyunkoo Lee, Joowon Kim, June Yong Yang, Jaeryong Hwang, Eunho Yang | The development of vision-language and generative models has significantly advanced text-guided image editing, which seeks the \textit{preservation} of core elements in the source image while implementing \textit{modifications} based on the target text. However, existing metrics have a \textbf{context-blindness} problem, indiscriminately applying the same evaluation criteria on completely different pairs of source image and target text, biasing towards either modification or preservation. Directional CLIP similarity, the only metric that considers both source image and target text, is also biased towards modification aspects and attends to irrelevant editing regions of the image. We propose \texttt{AugCLIP}, a \textbf{context-aware} metric that adaptively coordinates preservation and modification aspects, depending on the specific context of a given source image and target text. This is done by deriving the CLIP representation of an ideally edited image, that preserves the source image with necessary modifications to align with target text. More specifically, using a multi-modal large language model, \texttt{AugCLIP} augments the textual descriptions of the source and target, then calculates a modification vector through a hyperplane that separates source and target attributes in CLIP space. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, encompassing a diverse range of editing scenarios, show that \texttt{AugCLIP} aligns remarkably well with human evaluation standards, outperforming existing metrics. The code will be open-sourced for community use. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.11374v2) | [https://github.com/imagic-editing/imagic-editing](https://github.com/imagic-editing/imagic-editing), [https://github.com/deep-ml-research/editval_code](https://github.com/deep-ml-research/editval_code), [https://github.com/google/dreambooth](https://github.com/google/dreambooth), [https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/MagicBrush](https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/MagicBrush), [https://github.com/timothybrooks/instruct-pix2pix](https://github.com/timothybrooks/instruct-pix2pix), [https://github.com/Xiang-cd/DiffEdit-stable-diffusion](https://github.com/Xiang-cd/DiffEdit-stable-diffusion), [https://github.com/google/prompt-to-prompt](https://github.com/google/prompt-to-prompt), [https://github.com/google/prompt-to-prompt](https://github.com/google/prompt-to-prompt), [https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers), [https://github.com/gwang-kim/DiffusionCLIP](https://github.com/gwang-kim/DiffusionCLIP), [https://github.com/orpatashnik/StyleCLIP](https://github.com/orpatashnik/StyleCLIP), [https://github.com/adobe-research/custom-diffusion](https://github.com/adobe-research/custom-diffusion), [https://github.com/salesforce/LAVIS](https://github.com/salesforce/LAVIS), [https://github.com/csyxwei/ELITE](https://github.com/csyxwei/ELITE), [https://github.com/openai/CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP) |
| Sonic: Shifting Focus to Global Audio Perception in Portrait Animation | Xiaozhong Ji, Xiaobin Hu, Zhihong Xu, Junwei Zhu, Chuming Lin, Qingdong He, Jiangning Zhang, Donghao Luo, Yi Chen, Qin Lin, Qinglin Lu, Chengjie Wang | The study of talking face generation mainly explores the intricacies of synchronizing facial movements and crafting visually appealing, temporally-coherent animations. However, due to the limited exploration of global audio perception, current approaches predominantly employ auxiliary visual and spatial knowledge to stabilize the movements, which often results in the deterioration of the naturalness and temporal inconsistencies.Considering the essence of audio-driven animation, the audio signal serves as the ideal and unique priors to adjust facial expressions and lip movements, without resorting to interference of any visual signals. Based on this motivation, we propose a novel paradigm, dubbed as Sonic, to {s}hift f{o}cus on the exploration of global audio per{c}ept{i}o{n}.To effectively leverage global audio knowledge, we disentangle it into intra- and inter-clip audio perception and collaborate with both aspects to enhance overall perception.For the intra-clip audio perception, 1). \textbf{Context-enhanced audio learning}, in which long-range intra-clip temporal audio knowledge is extracted to provide facial expression and lip motion priors implicitly expressed as the tone and speed of speech. 2). \textbf{Motion-decoupled controller}, in which the motion of the head and expression movement are disentangled and independently controlled by intra-audio clips. Most importantly, for inter-clip audio perception, as a bridge to connect the intra-clips to achieve the global perception, \textbf{Time-aware position shift fusion}, in which the global inter-clip audio information is considered and fused for long-audio inference via through consecutively time-aware shifted windows. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the novel audio-driven paradigm outperform existing SOTA methodologies in terms of video quality, temporally consistency, lip synchronization precision, and motion diversity. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16331v1) | [https://jixiaozhong.github.io/Sonic](https://jixiaozhong.github.io/Sonic) |
| FATE: Full-head Gaussian Avatar with Textural Editing from Monocular Video | Jiawei Zhang, Zijian Wu, Zhiyang Liang, Yicheng Gong, Dongfang Hu, Yao Yao, Xun Cao, Hao Zhu | Reconstructing high-fidelity, animatable 3D head avatars from effortlessly captured monocular videos is a pivotal yet formidable challenge. Although significant progress has been made in rendering performance and manipulation capabilities, notable challenges remain, including incomplete reconstruction and inefficient Gaussian representation. To address these challenges, we introduce FATE, a novel method for reconstructing an editable full-head avatar from a single monocular video. FATE integrates a sampling-based densification strategy to ensure optimal positional distribution of points, improving rendering efficiency. A neural baking technique is introduced to convert discrete Gaussian representations into continuous attribute maps, facilitating intuitive appearance editing. Furthermore, we propose a universal completion framework to recover non-frontal appearance, culminating in a 360$^\circ$-renderable 3D head avatar. FATE outperforms previous approaches in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, achieving state-of-the-art performance. To the best of our knowledge, FATE is the first animatable and 360$^\circ$ full-head monocular reconstruction method for a 3D head avatar. The code will be publicly released upon publication. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.15604v1) | N/A |
| UniRestore: Unified Perceptual and Task-Oriented Image Restoration Model Using Diffusion Prior | I-Hsiang Chen, Wei-Ting Chen, Yu-Wei Liu, Yuan-Chun Chiang, Sy-Yen Kuo, Ming-Hsuan Yang | Image restoration aims to recover content from inputs degraded by various factors, such as adverse weather, blur, and noise. Perceptual Image Restoration (PIR) methods improve visual quality but often do not support downstream tasks effectively. On the other hand, Task-oriented Image Restoration (TIR) methods focus on enhancing image utility for high-level vision tasks, sometimes compromising visual quality. This paper introduces UniRestore, a unified image restoration model that bridges the gap between PIR and TIR by using a diffusion prior. The diffusion prior is designed to generate images that align with human visual quality preferences, but these images are often unsuitable for TIR scenarios. To solve this limitation, UniRestore utilizes encoder features from an autoencoder to adapt the diffusion prior to specific tasks. We propose a Complementary Feature Restoration Module (CFRM) to reconstruct degraded encoder features and a Task Feature Adapter (TFA) module to facilitate adaptive feature fusion in the decoder. This design allows UniRestore to optimize images for both human perception and downstream task requirements, addressing discrepancies between visual quality and functional needs. Integrating these modules also enhances UniRestore's adapability and efficiency across diverse tasks. Extensive expertments demonstrate the superior performance of UniRestore in both PIR and TIR scenarios. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13134v1) | N/A |
| Cropper: Vision-Language Model for Image Cropping through In-Context Learning | Seung Hyun Lee, Junjie Ke, Yinxiao Li, Junfeng He, Steven Hickson, Katie Datsenko, Sangpil Kim, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Irfan Essa, Feng Yang | The goal of image cropping is to identify visually appealing crops within an image. Conventional methods rely on specialized architectures trained on specific datasets, which struggle to be adapted to new requirements. Recent breakthroughs in large vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled visual in-context learning without explicit training. However, effective strategies for vision downstream tasks with VLMs remain largely unclear and underexplored. In this paper, we propose an effective approach to leverage VLMs for better image cropping. First, we propose an efficient prompt retrieval mechanism for image cropping to automate the selection of in-context examples. Second, we introduce an iterative refinement strategy to iteratively enhance the predicted crops. The proposed framework, named Cropper, is applicable to a wide range of cropping tasks, including free-form cropping, subject-aware cropping, and aspect ratio-aware cropping. Extensive experiments and a user study demonstrate that Cropper significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across several benchmarks. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07790v1) | N/A |
| Improving Transferable Targeted Attacks with Feature Tuning Mixup | Kaisheng Liang, Xuelong Dai, Yanjie Li, Dong Wang, Bin Xiao | Deep neural networks exhibit vulnerability to adversarial examples that can transfer across different models. A particularly challenging problem is developing transferable targeted attacks that can mislead models into predicting specific target classes. While various methods have been proposed to enhance attack transferability, they often incur substantial computational costs while yielding limited improvements. Recent clean feature mixup methods use random clean features to perturb the feature space but lack optimization for disrupting adversarial examples, overlooking the advantages of attack-specific perturbations. In this paper, we propose Feature Tuning Mixup (FTM), a novel method that enhances targeted attack transferability by combining both random and optimized noises in the feature space. FTM introduces learnable feature perturbations and employs an efficient stochastic update strategy for optimization. These learnable perturbations facilitate the generation of more robust adversarial examples with improved transferability. We further demonstrate that attack performance can be enhanced through an ensemble of multiple FTM-perturbed surrogate models. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet-compatible dataset across various models demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods while maintaining low computational cost. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.15553v1) | N/A |
| Golden Cudgel Network for Real-Time Semantic Segmentation | Guoyu Yang, Yuan Wang, Daming Shi, Yanzhong Wang | Recent real-time semantic segmentation models, whether single-branch or multi-branch, achieve good performance and speed. However, their speed is limited by multi-path blocks, and some depend on high-performance teacher models for training. To overcome these issues, we propose Golden Cudgel Network (GCNet). Specifically, GCNet uses vertical multi-convolutions and horizontal multi-paths for training, which are reparameterized into a single convolution for inference, optimizing both performance and speed. This design allows GCNet to self-enlarge during training and self-contract during inference, effectively becoming a "teacher model" without needing external ones. Experimental results show that GCNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in terms of performance and speed on the Cityscapes, CamVid, and Pascal VOC 2012 datasets.

| VideoEspresso: A Large-Scale Chain-of-Thought Dataset for Fine-Grained Video Reasoning via Core Frame Selection | Songhao Han, Wei Huang, Hairong Shi, Le Zhuo, Xiu Su, Shifeng Zhang, Xu Zhou, Xiaojuan Qi, Yue Liao, Si Liu | The advancement of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) has significantly improved multimodal understanding, yet challenges remain in video reasoning tasks due to the scarcity of high-quality, large-scale datasets. Existing video question-answering (VideoQA) datasets often rely on costly manual annotations with insufficient granularity or automatic construction methods with redundant frame-by-frame analysis, limiting their scalability and effectiveness for complex reasoning. To address these challenges, we introduce VideoEspresso, a novel dataset that features VideoQA pairs preserving essential spatial details and temporal coherence, along with multimodal annotations of intermediate reasoning steps. Our construction pipeline employs a semantic-aware method to reduce redundancy, followed by generating QA pairs using GPT-4o. We further develop video Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations to enrich reasoning processes, guiding GPT-4o in extracting logical relationships from QA pairs and video content. To exploit the potential of high-quality VideoQA pairs, we propose a Hybrid LVLMs Collaboration framework, featuring a Frame Selector and a two-stage instruction fine-tuned reasoning LVLM. This framework adaptively selects core frames and performs CoT reasoning using multimodal evidence. Evaluated on our proposed benchmark with 14 tasks against 9 popular LVLMs, our method outperforms existing baselines on most tasks, demonstrating superior video reasoning capabilities.

| OSDFace: One-Step Diffusion Model for Face Restoration | Jingkai Wang, Jue Gong, Lin Zhang, Zheng Chen, Xing Liu, Hong Gu, Yutong Liu, Yulun Zhang, Xiaokang Yang | Diffusion models have demonstrated impressive performance in face restoration. Yet, their multi-step inference process remains computationally intensive, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. Moreover, existing methods often struggle to generate face images that are harmonious, realistic, and consistent with the subject's identity. In this work, we propose OSDFace, a novel one-step diffusion model for face restoration. Specifically, we propose a visual representation embedder (VRE) to better capture prior information and understand the input face. In VRE, low-quality faces are processed by a visual tokenizer and subsequently embedded with a vector-quantized dictionary to generate visual prompts. Additionally, we incorporate a facial identity loss derived from face recognition to further ensure identity consistency. We further employ a generative adversarial network (GAN) as a guidance model to encourage distribution alignment between the restored face and the ground truth. Experimental results demonstrate that OSDFace surpasses current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both visual quality and quantitative metrics, generating high-fidelity, natural face images with high identity consistency.

| RaCFormer: Towards High-Quality 3D Object Detection via Query-based Radar-Camera Fusion | Xiaomeng Chu, Jiajun Deng, Guoliang You, Yifan Duan, Houqiang Li, Yanyong Zhang | We propose Radar-Camera fusion transformer (RaCFormer) to boost the accuracy of 3D object detection by the following insight. The Radar-Camera fusion in outdoor 3D scene perception is capped by the image-to-BEV transformation--if the depth of pixels is not accurately estimated, the naive combination of BEV features actually integrates unaligned visual content. To avoid this problem, we propose a query-based framework that enables adaptively sample instance-relevant features from both the BEV and the original image view. Furthermore, we enhance system performance by two key designs: optimizing query initialization and strengthening the representational capacity of BEV. For the former, we introduce an adaptive circular distribution in polar coordinates to refine the initialization of object queries, allowing for a distance-based adjustment of query density. For the latter, we initially incorporate a radar-guided depth head to refine the transformation from image view to BEV. Subsequently, we focus on leveraging the Doppler effect of radar and introduce an implicit dynamic catcher to capture the temporal elements within the BEV. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and View-of-Delft (VoD) datasets validate the merits of our design. Remarkably, our method achieves superior results of 64.9% mAP and 70.2% NDS on nuScenes, even outperforming several LiDAR-based detectors. RaCFormer also secures the 1st ranking on the VoD dataset. The code will be released. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12725v1) | N/A |

We propose a multi-step human-machine collaborative framework for efficient annotation, combining human insights with machine-generated descriptions to identify key transitions and assess alignment across multiple dimensions. Additionally, we introduce a novel evaluation framework with tasks and metrics to assess the multi-dimensional alignment of video and music, including rhythm, emotion, theme, and cultural context. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that HarmonySet, along with the proposed evaluation framework, significantly improves the ability of multimodal models to capture and analyze the intricate relationships between video and music. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.01725v2) | N/A |

This new paradigm provides strong guidance for unsupervised multimodal fusion without relying on abstract semantics, enhancing task-shared feature learning for broader applicability. Owning to the hybrid image features and enhanced universal representations, the proposed GIFNet supports diverse fusion tasks, achieving high performance across both seen and unseen scenarios with a single model.

| Forming Auxiliary High-confident Instance-level Loss to Promote Learning from Label Proportions | Tianhao Ma, Han Chen, Juncheng Hu, Yungang Zhu, Ximing Li | Learning from label proportions (LLP), i.e., a challenging weakly-supervised learning task, aims to train a classifier by using bags of instances and the proportions of classes within bags, rather than annotated labels for each instance. Beyond the traditional bag-level loss, the mainstream methodology of LLP is to incorporate an auxiliary instance-level loss with pseudo-labels formed by predictions. Unfortunately, we empirically observed that the pseudo-labels are are often inaccurate due to over-smoothing, especially for the scenarios with large bag sizes, hurting the classifier induction. To alleviate this problem, we suggest a novel LLP method, namely Learning from Label Proportions with Auxiliary High-confident Instance-level Loss (L^2P-AHIL). Specifically, we propose a dual entropy-based weight (DEW) method to adaptively measure the confidences of pseudo-labels. It simultaneously emphasizes accurate predictions at the bag level and avoids overly smoothed predictions. We then form high-confident instance-level loss with DEW, and jointly optimize it with the bag-level loss in a self-training manner. The experimental results on benchmark datasets show that L^2P-AHIL can surpass the existing baseline methods, and the performance gain can be more significant as the bag size increases. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.10364v1) | N/A |
| StyleStudio: Text-Driven Style Transfer with Selective Control of Style Elements | Mingkun Lei, Xue Song, Beier Zhu, Hao Wang, Chi Zhang | Text-driven style transfer aims to merge the style of a reference image with content described by a text prompt. Recent advancements in text-to-image models have improved the nuance of style transformations, yet significant challenges remain, particularly with overfitting to reference styles, limiting stylistic control, and misaligning with textual content. In this paper, we propose three complementary strategies to address these issues. First, we introduce a cross-modal Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) mechanism for better integration of style and text features, enhancing alignment. Second, we develop a Style-based Classifier-Free Guidance (SCFG) approach that enables selective control over stylistic elements, reducing irrelevant influences. Finally, we incorporate a teacher model during early generation stages to stabilize spatial layouts and mitigate artifacts. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in style transfer quality and alignment with textual prompts. Furthermore, our approach can be integrated into existing style transfer frameworks without fine-tuning. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08503v1) | N/A |

However, their efficiency has received much less attention. This paper introduces NVILA, a family of open VLMs designed to optimize both efficiency and accuracy. Building on top of VILA, we improve its model architecture by first scaling up the spatial and temporal resolutions, and then compressing visual tokens. This "scale-then-compress" approach enables NVILA to efficiently process high-resolution images and long videos. We also conduct a systematic investigation to enhance the efficiency of NVILA throughout its entire lifecycle, from training and fine-tuning to deployment. NVILA matches or surpasses the accuracy of many leading open and proprietary VLMs across a wide range of image and video benchmarks. At the same time, it reduces training costs by 4.5X, fine-tuning memory usage by 3.4X, pre-filling latency by 1.6-2.2X, and decoding latency by 1.2-2.8X. We will soon make our code and models available to facilitate reproducibility. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04468v2) | N/A |

In this paper, we introduce UniScene, the first unified framework for generating three key data forms - semantic occupancy, video, and LiDAR - in driving scenes. UniScene employs a progressive generation process that decomposes the complex task of scene generation into two hierarchical steps: (a) first generating semantic occupancy from a customized scene layout as a meta scene representation rich in both semantic and geometric information, and then (b) conditioned on occupancy, generating video and LiDAR data, respectively, with two novel transfer strategies of Gaussian-based Joint Rendering and Prior-guided Sparse Modeling. This occupancy-centric approach reduces the generation burden, especially for intricate scenes, while providing detailed intermediate representations for the subsequent generation stages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniScene outperforms previous SOTAs in the occupancy, video, and LiDAR generation, which also indeed benefits downstream driving tasks. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05435v1) | [https://arlo0o.github.io/uniscene](https://arlo0o.github.io/uniscene) |
| AutoURDF: Unsupervised Robot Modeling from Point Cloud Frames Using Cluster Registration | Jiong Lin, Lechen Zhang, Kwansoo Lee, Jialong Ning, Judah Goldfeder, Hod Lipson | Robot description models are essential for simulation and control, yet their creation often requires significant manual effort. To streamline this modeling process, we introduce AutoURDF, an unsupervised approach for constructing description files for unseen robots from point cloud frames. Our method leverages a cluster-based point cloud registration model that tracks the 6-DoF transformations of point clusters. Through analyzing cluster movements, we hierarchically address the following challenges: (1) moving part segmentation, (2) body topology inference, and (3) joint parameter estimation. The complete pipeline produces robot description files that are fully compatible with existing simulators. We validate our method across a variety of robots, using both synthetic and real-world scan data. Results indicate that our approach outperforms previous methods in registration and body topology estimation accuracy, offering a scalable solution for automated robot modeling. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05507v1) | N/A |
| PIDLoc: Cross-View Pose Optimization Network Inspired by PID Controllers | Wooju Lee, Juhye Park, Dasol Hong, Changki Sung, Youngwoo Seo, Dongwan Kang, Hyun Myung | Accurate localization is essential for autonomous driving, but GNSS-based methods struggle in challenging environments such as urban canyons. Cross-view pose optimization offers an effective solution by directly estimating vehicle pose using satellite-view images. However, existing methods primarily rely on cross-view features at a given pose, neglecting fine-grained contexts for precision and global contexts for robustness against large initial pose errors. To overcome these limitations, we propose PIDLoc, a novel cross-view pose optimization approach inspired by the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. Using RGB images and LiDAR, the PIDLoc comprises the PID branches to model cross-view feature relationships and the spatially aware pose estimator (SPE) to estimate the pose from these relationships. The PID branches leverage feature differences for local context (P), aggregated feature differences for global context (I), and gradients of feature differences for precise pose adjustment (D) to enhance localization accuracy under large initial pose errors. Integrated with the PID branches, the SPE captures spatial relationships within the PID-branch features for consistent localization. Experimental results demonstrate that the PIDLoc achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-view pose estimation for the KITTI dataset, reducing position error by $37.8\%$ compared with the previous state-of-the-art. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.02388v1) | N/A |
| AniMer: Animal Pose and Shape Estimation Using Family Aware Transformer | Jin Lyu, Tianyi Zhu, Yi Gu, Li Lin, Pujin Cheng, Yebin Liu, Xiaoying Tang, Liang An | Quantitative analysis of animal behavior and biomechanics requires accurate animal pose and shape estimation across species, and is important for animal welfare and biological research. However, the small network capacity of previous methods and limited multi-species dataset leave this problem underexplored. To this end, this paper presents AniMer to estimate animal pose and shape using family aware Transformer, enhancing the reconstruction accuracy of diverse quadrupedal families. A key insight of AniMer is its integration of a high-capacity Transformer-based backbone and an animal family supervised contrastive learning scheme, unifying the discriminative understanding of various quadrupedal shapes within a single framework. For effective training, we aggregate most available open-sourced quadrupedal datasets, either with 3D or 2D labels. To improve the diversity of 3D labeled data, we introduce CtrlAni3D, a novel large-scale synthetic dataset created through a new diffusion-based conditional image generation pipeline. CtrlAni3D consists of about 10k images with pixel-aligned SMAL labels. In total, we obtain 41.3k annotated images for training and validation. Consequently, the combination of a family aware Transformer network and an expansive dataset enables AniMer to outperform existing methods not only on 3D datasets like Animal3D and CtrlAni3D, but also on out-of-distribution Animal Kingdom dataset. Ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of our network design and CtrlAni3D in enhancing the performance of AniMer for in-the-wild applications.

| Homogeneous Dynamics Space for Heterogeneous Humans | Xinpeng Liu, Junxuan Liang, Chenshuo Zhang, Zixuan Cai, Cewu Lu, Yong-Lu Li | Analyses of human motion kinematics have achieved tremendous advances. However, the production mechanism, known as human dynamics, is still undercovered. In this paper, we aim to push data-driven human dynamics understanding forward. We identify a major obstacle to this as the heterogeneity of existing human motion understanding efforts. Specifically, heterogeneity exists in not only the diverse kinematics representations and hierarchical dynamics representations but also in the data from different domains, namely biomechanics and reinforcement learning. With an in-depth analysis of the existing heterogeneity, we propose to emphasize the beneath homogeneity: all of them represent the homogeneous fact of human motion, though from different perspectives. Given this, we propose Homogeneous Dynamics Space (HDyS) as a fundamental space for human dynamics by aggregating heterogeneous data and training a homogeneous latent space with inspiration from the inverse-forward dynamics procedure. Leveraging the heterogeneous representations and datasets, HDyS achieves decent mapping between human kinematics and dynamics. We demonstrate the feasibility of HDyS with extensive experiments and applications.

| StreamingT2V: Consistent, Dynamic, and Extendable Long Video Generation from Text | Roberto Henschel, Levon Khachatryan, Daniil Hayrapetyan, Hayk Poghosyan, Vahram Tadevosyan, Zhangyang Wang, Shant Navasardyan, Humphrey Shi | Text-to-video diffusion models enable the generation of high-quality videos that follow text instructions, making it easy to create diverse and individual content. However, existing approaches mostly focus on high-quality short video generation (typically 16 or 24 frames), ending up with hard-cuts when naively extended to the case of long video synthesis. To overcome these limitations, we introduce StreamingT2V, an autoregressive approach for long video generation of 80, 240, 600, 1200 or more frames with smooth transitions. The key components are:(i) a short-term memory block called conditional attention module (CAM), which conditions the current generation on the features extracted from the previous chunk via an attentional mechanism, leading to consistent chunk transitions, (ii) a long-term memory block called appearance preservation module, which extracts high-level scene and object features from the first video chunk to prevent the model from forgetting the initial scene, and (iii) a randomized blending approach that enables to apply a video enhancer autoregressively for infinitely long videos without inconsistencies between chunks. Experiments show that StreamingT2V generates high motion amount. In contrast, all competing image-to-video methods are prone to video stagnation when applied naively in an autoregressive manner. Thus, we propose with StreamingT2V a high-quality seamless text-to-long video generator that outperforms competitors with consistency and motion.

| Reanimating Images using Neural Representations of Dynamic Stimuli | Jacob Yeung, Andrew F. Luo, Gabriel Sarch, Margaret M. Henderson, Deva Ramanan, Michael J. Tarr | While computer vision models have made incredible strides in static image recognition, they still do not match human performance in tasks that require the understanding of complex, dynamic motion. This is notably true for real-world scenarios where embodied agents face complex and motion-rich environments. Our approach leverages state-of-the-art video diffusion models to decouple static image representation from motion generation, enabling us to utilize fMRI brain activity for a deeper understanding of human responses to dynamic visual stimuli. Conversely, we also demonstrate that information about the brain's representation of motion can enhance the prediction of optical flow in artificial systems. Our novel approach leads to four main findings: (1) Visual motion, represented as fine-grained, object-level resolution optical flow, can be decoded from brain activity generated by participants viewing video stimuli; (2) Video encoders outperform image-based models in predicting video-driven brain activity; (3) Brain-decoded motion signals enable realistic video reanimation based only on the initial frame of the video; and (4) We extend prior work to achieve full video decoding from video-driven brain activity. This framework advances our understanding of how the brain represents spatial and temporal information in dynamic visual scenes. Our findings demonstrate the potential of combining brain imaging with video diffusion models for developing more robust and biologically-inspired computer vision systems. We show additional decoding and encoding examples on this site: https://sites.google.com/view/neural-dynamics/home. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.02659v2) | N/A |
| PVC: Progressive Visual Token Compression for Unified Image and Video Processing in Large Vision-Language Models | Chenyu Yang, Xuan Dong, Xizhou Zhu, Weijie Su, Jiahao Wang, Hao Tian, Zhe Chen, Wenhai Wang, Lewei Lu, Jifeng Dai | Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been extended to understand both images and videos. Visual token compression is leveraged to reduce the considerable token length of visual inputs. To meet the needs of different tasks, existing high-performance models usually process images and videos separately with different token compression strategies, limiting the capabilities of combining images and videos. To this end, we extend each image into a "static" video and introduce a unified token compression strategy called Progressive Visual Token Compression (PVC), where the tokens of each frame are progressively encoded and adaptively compressed to supplement the information not extracted from previous frames. Video tokens are efficiently compressed with exploiting the inherent temporal redundancy. Images are repeated as static videos, and the spatial details can be gradually supplemented in multiple frames. PVC unifies the token compressing of images and videos. With a limited number of tokens per frame (64 tokens by default), spatial details and temporal changes can still be preserved. Experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across various video understanding benchmarks, including long video tasks and fine-grained short video tasks. Meanwhile, our unified token compression strategy incurs no performance loss on image benchmarks, particularly in detail-sensitive tasks. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09613v1) | [https://github.com/OpenGVLab/PVC](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/PVC) |
| Learning Physics From Video: Unsupervised Physical Parameter Estimation for Continuous Dynamical Systems | Alejandro Castañeda Garcia, Jan van Gemert, Daan Brinks, Nergis Tömen | Extracting physical dynamical system parameters from videos is of great interest to applications in natural science and technology. The state-of-the-art in automatic parameter estimation from video is addressed by training supervised deep networks on large datasets. Such datasets require labels, which are difficult to acquire. While some unsupervised techniques -- which depend on frame prediction -- exist, they suffer from long training times, instability under different initializations, and are limited to hand-picked motion problems. In this work, we propose a method to estimate the physical parameters of any known, continuous governing equation from single videos; our solution is suitable for different dynamical systems beyond motion and is robust to initialization compared to previous approaches. Moreover, we remove the need for frame prediction by implementing a KL-divergence-based loss function in the latent space, which avoids convergence to trivial solutions and reduces model size and compute. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.01376v1) | N/A |
| FOCUS: Knowledge-enhanced Adaptive Visual Compression for Few-shot Whole Slide Image Classification | Zhengrui Guo, Conghao Xiong, Jiabo Ma, Qichen Sun, Lishuang Feng, Jinzhuo Wang, Hao Chen | Few-shot learning presents a critical solution for cancer diagnosis in computational pathology (CPath), addressing fundamental limitations in data availability, particularly the scarcity of expert annotations and patient privacy constraints. A key challenge in this paradigm stems from the inherent disparity between the limited training set of whole slide images (WSIs) and the enormous number of contained patches, where a significant portion of these patches lacks diagnostically relevant information, potentially diluting the model's ability to learn and focus on critical diagnostic features. While recent works attempt to address this by incorporating additional knowledge, several crucial gaps hinder further progress: (1) despite the emergence of powerful pathology foundation models (FMs), their potential remains largely untapped, with most approaches limiting their use to basic feature extraction; (2) current language guidance mechanisms attempt to align text prompts with vast numbers of WSI patches all at once, struggling to leverage rich pathological semantic information. To this end, we introduce the knowledge-enhanced adaptive visual compression framework, dubbed FOCUS, which uniquely combines pathology FMs with language prior knowledge to enable a focused analysis of diagnostically relevant regions by prioritizing discriminative WSI patches. Our approach implements a progressive three-stage compression strategy: we first leverage FMs for global visual redundancy elimination, and integrate compressed features with language prompts for semantic relevance assessment, then perform neighbor-aware visual token filtering while preserving spatial coherence. Extensive experiments on pathological datasets spanning breast, lung, and ovarian cancers demonstrate its superior performance in few-shot pathology diagnosis.

| 3DGUT: Enabling Distorted Cameras and Secondary Rays in Gaussian Splatting | Qi Wu, Janick Martinez Esturo, Ashkan Mirzaei, Nicolas Moenne-Loccoz, Zan Gojcic | 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown great potential for efficient reconstruction and high-fidelity real-time rendering of complex scenes on consumer hardware. However, due to its rasterization-based formulation, 3DGS is constrained to ideal pinhole cameras and lacks support for secondary lighting effects. Recent methods address these limitations by tracing volumetric particles instead, however, this comes at the cost of significantly slower rendering speeds. In this work, we propose 3D Gaussian Unscented Transform (3DGUT), replacing the EWA splatting formulation in 3DGS with the Unscented Transform that approximates the particles through sigma points, which can be projected exactly under any nonlinear projection function. This modification enables trivial support of distorted cameras with time dependent effects such as rolling shutter, while retaining the efficiency of rasterization. Additionally, we align our rendering formulation with that of tracing-based methods, enabling secondary ray tracing required to represent phenomena such as reflections and refraction within the same 3D representation. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12507v1) | N/A |
| Towards Million-Scale Adversarial Robustness Evaluation With Stronger Individual Attacks | Yong Xie, Weijie Zheng, Hanxun Huang, Guangnan Ye, Xingjun Ma | As deep learning models are increasingly deployed in safety-critical applications, evaluating their vulnerabilities to adversarial perturbations is essential for ensuring their reliability and trustworthiness. Over the past decade, a large number of white-box adversarial robustness evaluation methods (i.e., attacks) have been proposed, ranging from single-step to multi-step methods and from individual to ensemble methods. Despite these advances, challenges remain in conducting meaningful and comprehensive robustness evaluations, particularly when it comes to large-scale testing and ensuring evaluations reflect real-world adversarial risks. In this work, we focus on image classification models and propose a novel individual attack method, Probability Margin Attack (PMA), which defines the adversarial margin in the probability space rather than the logits space. We analyze the relationship between PMA and existing cross-entropy or logits-margin-based attacks, and show that PMA can outperform the current state-of-the-art individual methods. Building on PMA, we propose two types of ensemble attacks that balance effectiveness and efficiency. Furthermore, we create a million-scale dataset, CC1M, derived from the existing CC3M dataset, and use it to conduct the first million-scale white-box adversarial robustness evaluation of adversarially-trained ImageNet models. Our findings provide valuable insights into the robustness gaps between individual versus ensemble attacks and small-scale versus million-scale evaluations. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.15210v2) | N/A |
| Sufficient Invariant Learning for Distribution Shift | Taero Kim, Subeen Park, Sungjun Lim, Yonghan Jung, Krikamol Muandet, Kyungwoo Song | Learning robust models under distribution shifts between training and test datasets is a fundamental challenge in machine learning. While learning invariant features across environments is a popular approach, it often assumes that these features are fully observed in both training and test sets-a condition frequently violated in practice. When models rely on invariant features absent in the test set, their robustness in new environments can deteriorate. To tackle this problem, we introduce a novel learning principle called the Sufficient Invariant Learning (SIL) framework, which focuses on learning a sufficient subset of invariant features rather than relying on a single feature. After demonstrating the limitation of existing invariant learning methods, we propose a new algorithm, Adaptive Sharpness-aware Group Distributionally Robust Optimization (ASGDRO), to learn diverse invariant features by seeking common flat minima across the environments. We theoretically demonstrate that finding a common flat minima enables robust predictions based on diverse invariant features. Empirical evaluations on multiple datasets, including our new benchmark, confirm ASGDRO's robustness against distribution shifts, highlighting the limitations of existing methods. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.13533v3) | [https://github.com/huaxiuyao/LISA](https://github.com/huaxiuyao/LISA), [https://github.com/shogi880/DPLCLIP](https://github.com/shogi880/DPLCLIP) |
| AutoLUT: LUT-Based Image Super-Resolution with Automatic Sampling and Adaptive Residual Learning | Yuheng Xu, Shijie Yang, Xin Liu, Jie Liu, Jie Tang, Gangshan Wu | In recent years, the increasing popularity of Hi-DPI screens has driven a rising demand for high-resolution images. However, the limited computational power of edge devices poses a challenge in deploying complex super-resolution neural networks, highlighting the need for efficient methods. While prior works have made significant progress, they have not fully exploited pixel-level information. Moreover, their reliance on fixed sampling patterns limits both accuracy and the ability to capture fine details in low-resolution images. To address these challenges, we introduce two plug-and-play modules designed to capture and leverage pixel information effectively in Look-Up Table (LUT) based super-resolution networks. Our method introduces Automatic Sampling (AutoSample), a flexible LUT sampling approach where sampling weights are automatically learned during training to adapt to pixel variations and expand the receptive field without added inference cost. We also incorporate Adaptive Residual Learning (AdaRL) to enhance inter-layer connections, enabling detailed information flow and improving the network's ability to reconstruct fine details. Our method achieves significant performance improvements on both MuLUT and SPF-LUT while maintaining similar storage sizes. Specifically, for MuLUT, we achieve a PSNR improvement of approximately +0.20 dB improvement on average across five datasets. For SPF-LUT, with more than a 50% reduction in storage space and about a 2/3 reduction in inference time, our method still maintains performance comparable to the original.

| Evaluating Model Perception of Color Illusions in Photorealistic Scenes | Lingjun Mao, Zineng Tang, Alane Suhr | We study the perception of color illusions by vision-language models. Color illusion, where a person's visual system perceives color differently from actual color, is well-studied in human vision. However, it remains underexplored whether vision-language models (VLMs), trained on large-scale human data, exhibit similar perceptual biases when confronted with such color illusions. We propose an automated framework for generating color illusion images, resulting in RCID (Realistic Color Illusion Dataset), a dataset of 19,000 realistic illusion images. Our experiments show that all studied VLMs exhibit perceptual biases similar human vision. Finally, we train a model to distinguish both human perception and actual pixel differences. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06184v1) | [https://github.com/mao1207/RCID](https://github.com/mao1207/RCID) |
| Generative Video Propagation | Shaoteng Liu, Tianyu Wang, Jui-Hsien Wang, Qing Liu, Zhifei Zhang, Joon-Young Lee, Yijun Li, Bei Yu, Zhe Lin, Soo Ye Kim, Jiaya Jia | Large-scale video generation models have the inherent ability to realistically model natural scenes. In this paper, we demonstrate that through a careful design of a generative video propagation framework, various video tasks can be addressed in a unified way by leveraging the generative power of such models. Specifically, our framework, GenProp, encodes the original video with a selective content encoder and propagates the changes made to the first frame using an image-to-video generation model. We propose a data generation scheme to cover multiple video tasks based on instance-level video segmentation datasets. Our model is trained by incorporating a mask prediction decoder head and optimizing a region-aware loss to aid the encoder to preserve the original content while the generation model propagates the modified region. This novel design opens up new possibilities: In editing scenarios, GenProp allows substantial changes to an object's shape; for insertion, the inserted objects can exhibit independent motion; for removal, GenProp effectively removes effects like shadows and reflections from the whole video; for tracking, GenProp is capable of tracking objects and their associated effects together. Experiment results demonstrate the leading performance of our model in various video tasks, and we further provide in-depth analyses of the proposed framework. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19761v1) | N/A |
| ReVisionLLM: Recursive Vision-Language Model for Temporal Grounding in Hour-Long Videos | Tanveer Hannan, Md Mohaiminul Islam, Jindong Gu, Thomas Seidl, Gedas Bertasius | Large language models (LLMs) excel at retrieving information from lengthy text, but their vision-language counterparts (VLMs) face difficulties with hour-long videos, especially for temporal grounding. Specifically, these VLMs are constrained by frame limitations, often losing essential temporal details needed for accurate event localization in extended video content. We propose ReVisionLLM, a recursive vision-language model designed to locate events in hour-long videos. Inspired by human search strategies, our model initially targets broad segments of interest, progressively revising its focus to pinpoint exact temporal boundaries. Our model can seamlessly handle videos of vastly different lengths, from minutes to hours. We also introduce a hierarchical training strategy that starts with short clips to capture distinct events and progressively extends to longer videos. To our knowledge, ReVisionLLM is the first VLM capable of temporal grounding in hour-long videos, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets by a significant margin (+2.6% R1@0.1 on MAD).

| Perception Tokens Enhance Visual Reasoning in Multimodal Language Models | Mahtab Bigverdi, Zelun Luo, Cheng-Yu Hsieh, Ethan Shen, Dongping Chen, Linda G. Shapiro, Ranjay Krishna | Multimodal language models (MLMs) still face challenges in fundamental visual perception tasks where specialized models excel. Tasks requiring reasoning about 3D structures benefit from depth estimation, and reasoning about 2D object instances benefits from object detection. Yet, MLMs can not produce intermediate depth or boxes to reason over. Finetuning MLMs on relevant data doesn't generalize well and outsourcing computation to specialized vision tools is too compute-intensive and memory-inefficient. To address this, we introduce Perception Tokens, intrinsic image representations designed to assist reasoning tasks where language is insufficient. Perception tokens act as auxiliary reasoning tokens, akin to chain-of-thought prompts in language models. For example, in a depth-related task, an MLM augmented with perception tokens can reason by generating a depth map as tokens, enabling it to solve the problem effectively. We propose AURORA, a training method that augments MLMs with perception tokens for improved reasoning over visual inputs. AURORA leverages a VQVAE to transform intermediate image representations, such as depth maps into a tokenized format and bounding box tokens, which is then used in a multi-task training framework. AURORA achieves notable improvements across counting benchmarks: +10.8% on BLINK, +11.3% on CVBench, and +8.3% on SEED-Bench, outperforming finetuning approaches in generalization across datasets. It also improves on relative depth: over +6% on BLINK. With perception tokens, AURORA expands the scope of MLMs beyond language-based reasoning, paving the way for more effective visual reasoning capabilities. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03548v2) | N/A |
| REALEDIT: Reddit Edits As a Large-scale Empirical Dataset for Image Transformations | Peter Sushko, Ayana Bharadwaj, Zhi Yang Lim, Vasily Ilin, Ben Caffee, Dongping Chen, Mohammadreza Salehi, Cheng-Yu Hsieh, Ranjay Krishna | Existing image editing models struggle to meet real-world demands. Despite excelling in academic benchmarks, they have yet to be widely adopted for real user needs. Datasets that power these models use artificial edits, lacking the scale and ecological validity necessary to address the true diversity of user requests. We introduce REALEDIT, a large-scale image editing dataset with authentic user requests and human-made edits sourced from Reddit. REALEDIT includes a test set of 9300 examples to evaluate models on real user requests. Our results show that existing models fall short on these tasks, highlighting the need for realistic training data. To address this, we introduce 48K training examples and train our REALEDIT model, achieving substantial gains - outperforming competitors by up to 165 Elo points in human judgment and 92 percent relative improvement on the automated VIEScore metric. We deploy our model on Reddit, testing it on new requests, and receive positive feedback. Beyond image editing, we explore REALEDIT's potential in detecting edited images by partnering with a deepfake detection non-profit. Finetuning their model on REALEDIT data improves its F1-score by 14 percentage points, underscoring the dataset's value for broad applications. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.03629v1) | N/A |
| Multiple Object Tracking as ID Prediction | Ruopeng Gao, Yijun Zhang, Limin Wang | In Multiple Object Tracking (MOT), tracking-by-detection methods have stood the test for a long time, which split the process into two parts according to the definition: object detection and association. They leverage robust single-frame detectors and treat object association as a post-processing step through hand-crafted heuristic algorithms and surrogate tasks. However, the nature of heuristic techniques prevents end-to-end exploitation of training data, leading to increasingly cumbersome and challenging manual modification while facing complicated or novel scenarios. In this paper, we regard this object association task as an End-to-End in-context ID prediction problem and propose a streamlined baseline called MOTIP. Specifically, we form the target embeddings into historical trajectory information while considering the corresponding IDs as in-context prompts, then directly predict the ID labels for the objects in the current frame. Thanks to this end-to-end process, MOTIP can learn tracking capabilities straight from training data, freeing itself from burdensome hand-crafted algorithms. Without bells and whistles, our method achieves impressive state-of-the-art performance in complex scenarios like DanceTrack and SportsMOT, and it performs competitively with other transformer-based methods on MOT17. We believe that MOTIP demonstrates remarkable potential and can serve as a starting point for future research.

| SelfSplat: Pose-Free and 3D Prior-Free Generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting | Gyeongjin Kang, Jisang Yoo, Jihyeon Park, Seungtae Nam, Hyeonsoo Im, Sangheon Shin, Sangpil Kim, Eunbyung Park | We propose SelfSplat, a novel 3D Gaussian Splatting model designed to perform pose-free and 3D prior-free generalizable 3D reconstruction from unposed multi-view images. These settings are inherently ill-posed due to the lack of ground-truth data, learned geometric information, and the need to achieve accurate 3D reconstruction without finetuning, making it difficult for conventional methods to achieve high-quality results. Our model addresses these challenges by effectively integrating explicit 3D representations with self-supervised depth and pose estimation techniques, resulting in reciprocal improvements in both pose accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. Furthermore, we incorporate a matching-aware pose estimation network and a depth refinement module to enhance geometry consistency across views, ensuring more accurate and stable 3D reconstructions. To present the performance of our method, we evaluated it on large-scale real-world datasets, including RealEstate10K, ACID, and DL3DV. SelfSplat achieves superior results over previous state-of-the-art methods in both appearance and geometry quality, also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization capabilities. Extensive ablation studies and analysis also validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.

MMVU includes 3,000 expert-annotated questions spanning 27 subjects across four core disciplines: Science, Healthcare, Humanities & Social Sciences, and Engineering. Compared to prior benchmarks, MMVU features three key advancements. First, it challenges models to apply domain-specific knowledge and perform expert-level reasoning to analyze specialized-domain videos, moving beyond the basic visual perception typically assessed in current video benchmarks. Second, each example is annotated by human experts from scratch. We implement strict data quality controls to ensure the high quality of the dataset. Finally, each example is enriched with expert-annotated reasoning rationals and relevant domain knowledge, facilitating in-depth analysis. We conduct an extensive evaluation of 32 frontier multimodal foundation models on MMVU. The latest System-2-capable models, o1 and Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, achieve the highest performance among the tested models. However, they still fall short of matching human expertise. Through in-depth error analyses and case studies, we offer actionable insights for future advancements in expert-level, knowledge-intensive video understanding for specialized domains. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12380v1) | N/A |
| Temporal Separation with Entropy Regularization for Knowledge Distillation in Spiking Neural Networks | Kairong Yu, Chengting Yu, Tianqing Zhang, Xiaochen Zhao, Shu Yang, Hongwei Wang, Qiang Zhang, Qi Xu | Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the human brain, offer significant computational efficiency through discrete spike-based information transfer. Despite their potential to reduce inference energy consumption, a performance gap persists between SNNs and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), primarily due to current training methods and inherent model limitations. While recent research has aimed to enhance SNN learning by employing knowledge distillation (KD) from ANN teacher networks, traditional distillation techniques often overlook the distinctive spatiotemporal properties of SNNs, thus failing to fully leverage their advantages. To overcome these challenge, we propose a novel logit distillation method characterized by temporal separation and entropy regularization. This approach improves existing SNN distillation techniques by performing distillation learning on logits across different time steps, rather than merely on aggregated output features. Furthermore, the integration of entropy regularization stabilizes model optimization and further boosts the performance. Extensive experimental results indicate that our method surpasses prior SNN distillation strategies, whether based on logit distillation, feature distillation, or a combination of both. The code will be available on GitHub. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.03144v1) | N/A |
| Noise Diffusion for Enhancing Semantic Faithfulness in Text-to-Image Synthesis | Boming Miao, Chunxiao Li, Xiaoxiao Wang, Andi Zhang, Rui Sun, Zizhe Wang, Yao Zhu | Diffusion models have achieved impressive success in generating photorealistic images, but challenges remain in ensuring precise semantic alignment with input prompts. Optimizing the initial noisy latent offers a more efficient alternative to modifying model architectures or prompt engineering for improving semantic alignment. A latest approach, InitNo, refines the initial noisy latent by leveraging attention maps; however, these maps capture only limited information, and the effectiveness of InitNo is highly dependent on the initial starting point, as it tends to converge on a local optimum near this point. To this end, this paper proposes leveraging the language comprehension capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs) to guide the optimization of the initial noisy latent, and introduces the Noise Diffusion process, which updates the noisy latent to generate semantically faithful images while preserving distribution consistency. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of the condition under which the update improves semantic faithfulness. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of our framework, consistently enhancing semantic alignment across various diffusion models.

| CAP4D: Creating Animatable 4D Portrait Avatars with Morphable Multi-View Diffusion Models | Felix Taubner, Ruihang Zhang, Mathieu Tuli, David B. Lindell | Reconstructing photorealistic and dynamic portrait avatars from images is essential to many applications including advertising, visual effects, and virtual reality. Depending on the application, avatar reconstruction involves different capture setups and constraints $-$ for example, visual effects studios use camera arrays to capture hundreds of reference images, while content creators may seek to animate a single portrait image downloaded from the internet. As such, there is a large and heterogeneous ecosystem of methods for avatar reconstruction. Techniques based on multi-view stereo or neural rendering achieve the highest quality results, but require hundreds of reference images. Recent generative models produce convincing avatars from a single reference image, but visual fidelity yet lags behind multi-view techniques. Here, we present CAP4D: an approach that uses a morphable multi-view diffusion model to reconstruct photoreal 4D (dynamic 3D) portrait avatars from any number of reference images (i.e., one to 100) and animate and render them in real time. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance for single-, few-, and multi-image 4D portrait avatar reconstruction, and takes steps to bridge the gap in visual fidelity between single-image and multi-view reconstruction techniques. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12093v1) | [https://felixtaubner.github.io/cap4d](https://felixtaubner.github.io/cap4d) |
| DeNVeR: Deformable Neural Vessel Representations for Unsupervised Video Vessel Segmentation | Chun-Hung Wu, Shih-Hong Chen, Chih-Yao Hu, Hsin-Yu Wu, Kai-Hsin Chen, Yu-You Chen, Chih-Hai Su, Chih-Kuo Lee, Yu-Lun Liu | This paper presents Deformable Neural Vessel Representations (DeNVeR), an unsupervised approach for vessel segmentation in X-ray angiography videos without annotated ground truth. DeNVeR utilizes optical flow and layer separation techniques, enhancing segmentation accuracy and adaptability through test-time training. Key contributions include a novel layer separation bootstrapping technique, a parallel vessel motion loss, and the integration of Eulerian motion fields for modeling complex vessel dynamics. A significant component of this research is the introduction of the XACV dataset, the first X-ray angiography coronary video dataset with high-quality, manually labeled segmentation ground truth. Extensive evaluations on both XACV and CADICA datasets demonstrate that DeNVeR outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in vessel segmentation accuracy and generalization capability while maintaining temporal coherency.

| Repurposing Stable Diffusion Attention for Training-Free Unsupervised Interactive Segmentation | Markus Karmann, Onay Urfalioglu | Recent progress in interactive point prompt based Image Segmentation allows to significantly reduce the manual effort to obtain high quality semantic labels. State-of-the-art unsupervised methods use self-supervised pre-trained models to obtain pseudo-labels which are used in training a prompt-based segmentation model. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised and training-free approach based solely on the self-attention of Stable Diffusion. We interpret the self-attention tensor as a Markov transition operator, which enables us to iteratively construct a Markov chain. Pixel-wise counting of the required number of iterations along the Markov-chain to reach a relative probability threshold yields a Markov-iteration-map, which we simply call a Markov-map. Compared to the raw attention maps, we show that our proposed Markov-map has less noise, sharper semantic boundaries and more uniform values within semantically similar regions. We integrate the Markov-map in a simple yet effective truncated nearest neighbor framework to obtain interactive point prompt based segmentation. Despite being training-free, we experimentally show that our approach yields excellent results in terms of Number of Clicks (NoC), even outperforming state-of-the-art training based unsupervised methods in most of the datasets. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.10411v1) | N/A |
| EgoPressure: A Dataset for Hand Pressure and Pose Estimation in Egocentric Vision | Yiming Zhao, Taein Kwon, Paul Streli, Marc Pollefeys, Christian Holz | Touch contact and pressure are essential for understanding how humans interact with and manipulate objects, insights which can significantly benefit applications in mixed reality and robotics. However, estimating these interactions from an egocentric camera perspective is challenging, largely due to the lack of comprehensive datasets that provide both accurate hand poses on contacting surfaces and detailed annotations of pressure information. In this paper, we introduce EgoPressure, a novel egocentric dataset that captures detailed touch contact and pressure interactions. EgoPressure provides high-resolution pressure intensity annotations for each contact point and includes accurate hand pose meshes obtained through our proposed multi-view, sequence-based optimization method processing data from an 8-camera capture rig. Our dataset comprises 5 hours of recorded interactions from 21 participants captured simultaneously by one head-mounted and seven stationary Kinect cameras, which acquire RGB images and depth maps at 30 Hz. To support future research and benchmarking, we present several baseline models for estimating applied pressure on external surfaces from RGB images, with and without hand pose information. We further explore the joint estimation of the hand mesh and applied pressure. Our experiments demonstrate that pressure and hand pose are complementary for understanding hand-object interactions. ng of hand-object interactions in AR/VR and robotics research.

Guibas, Guandao Yang, Gordon Wetzstein | Apparel is essential to human life, offering protection, mirroring cultural identities, and showcasing personal style. Yet, the creation of garments remains a time-consuming process, largely due to the manual work involved in designing them. To simplify this process, we introduce AIpparel, a large multimodal model for generating and editing sewing patterns. Our model fine-tunes state-of-the-art large multimodal models (LMMs) on a custom-curated large-scale dataset of over 120,000 unique garments, each with multimodal annotations including text, images, and sewing patterns. Additionally, we propose a novel tokenization scheme that concisely encodes these complex sewing patterns so that LLMs can learn to predict them efficiently. AIpparel achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-modal tasks, including text-to-garment and image-to-garment prediction, and enables novel multimodal garment generation applications such as interactive garment editing.

| MambaVLT: Time-Evolving Multimodal State Space Model for Vision-Language Tracking | Xinqi Liu, Li Zhou, Zikun Zhou, Jianqiu Chen, Zhenyu He | The vision-language tracking task aims to perform object tracking based on various modality references. Existing Transformer-based vision-language tracking methods have made remarkable progress by leveraging the global modeling ability of self-attention. However, current approaches still face challenges in effectively exploiting the temporal information and dynamically updating reference features during tracking. Recently, the State Space Model (SSM), known as Mamba, has shown astonishing ability in efficient long-sequence modeling. Particularly, its state space evolving process demonstrates promising capabilities in memorizing multimodal temporal information with linear complexity. Witnessing its success, we propose a Mamba-based vision-language tracking model to exploit its state space evolving ability in temporal space for robust multimodal tracking, dubbed MambaVLT. In particular, our approach mainly integrates a time-evolving hybrid state space block and a selective locality enhancement block, to capture contextual information for multimodal modeling and adaptive reference feature update. Besides, we introduce a modality-selection module that dynamically adjusts the weighting between visual and language references, mitigating potential ambiguities from either reference type. Extensive experimental results show that our method performs favorably against state-of-the-art trackers across diverse benchmarks. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.15459v1) | N/A |
| Towards a Universal Synthetic Video Detector: From Face or Background Manipulations to Fully AI-Generated Content | Rohit Kundu, Hao Xiong, Vishal Mohanty, Athula Balachandran, Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury | Existing DeepFake detection techniques primarily focus on facial manipulations, such as face-swapping or lip-syncing. However, advancements in text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V) generative models now allow fully AI-generated synthetic content and seamless background alterations, challenging face-centric detection methods and demanding more versatile approaches.   To address this, we introduce the \underline{U}niversal \underline{N}etwork for \underline{I}dentifying \underline{T}ampered and synth\underline{E}tic videos (\texttt{UNITE}) model, which, unlike traditional detectors, captures full-frame manipulations. \texttt{UNITE} extends detection capabilities to scenarios without faces, non-human subjects, and complex background modifications. It leverages a transformer-based architecture that processes domain-agnostic features extracted from videos via the SigLIP-So400M foundation model. Given limited datasets encompassing both facial/background alterations and T2V/I2V content, we integrate task-irrelevant data alongside standard DeepFake datasets in training. We further mitigate the model's tendency to over-focus on faces by incorporating an attention-diversity (AD) loss, which promotes diverse spatial attention across video frames. Combining AD loss with cross-entropy improves detection performance across varied contexts. Comparative evaluations demonstrate that \texttt{UNITE} outperforms state-of-the-art detectors on datasets (in cross-data settings) featuring face/background manipulations and fully synthetic T2V/I2V videos, showcasing its adaptability and generalizable detection capabilities. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12278v1) | N/A |
| Learning Flow Fields in Attention for Controllable Person Image Generation | Zijian Zhou, Shikun Liu, Xiao Han, Haozhe Liu, Kam Woh Ng, Tian Xie, Yuren Cong, Hang Li, Mengmeng Xu, Juan-Manuel Pérez-Rúa, Aditya Patel, Tao Xiang, Miaojing Shi, Sen He | Controllable person image generation aims to generate a person image conditioned on reference images, allowing precise control over the person's appearance or pose. However, prior methods often distort fine-grained textural details from the reference image, despite achieving high overall image quality. We attribute these distortions to inadequate attention to corresponding regions in the reference image. To address this, we thereby propose learning flow fields in attention (Leffa), which explicitly guides the target query to attend to the correct reference key in the attention layer during training. Specifically, it is realized via a regularization loss on top of the attention map within a diffusion-based baseline. Our extensive experiments show that Leffa achieves state-of-the-art performance in controlling appearance (virtual try-on) and pose (pose transfer), significantly reducing fine-grained detail distortion while maintaining high image quality. Additionally, we show that our loss is model-agnostic and can be used to improve the performance of other diffusion models. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08486v2) | N/A |
| The Devil is in Temporal Token: High Quality Video Reasoning Segmentation | Sitong Gong, Yunzhi Zhuge, Lu Zhang, Zongxin Yang, Pingping Zhang, Huchuan Lu | Existing methods for Video Reasoning Segmentation rely heavily on a single special token to represent the object in the keyframe or the entire video, inadequately capturing spatial complexity and inter-frame motion. To overcome these challenges, we propose VRS-HQ, an end-to-end video reasoning segmentation approach that leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to inject rich spatiotemporal features into hierarchical tokens.Our key innovations include a Temporal Dynamic Aggregation (TDA) and a Token-driven Keyframe Selection (TKS). Specifically, we design frame-level <SEG> and temporal-level <TAK> tokens that utilize MLLM's autoregressive learning to effectively capture both local and global information. Subsequently, we apply a similarity-based weighted fusion and frame selection strategy, then utilize SAM2 to perform keyframe segmentation and propagation. To enhance keyframe localization accuracy, the TKS filters keyframes based on SAM2's occlusion scores during inference. VRS-HQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on ReVOS, surpassing VISA by 5.9%/12.5%/9.1% in J&F scores across the three subsets. These results highlight the strong temporal reasoning and segmentation capabilities of our method. Code and model weights will be released at VRS-HQ. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08549v1) | N/A |
| Localizing Events in Videos with Multimodal Queries | Gengyuan Zhang, Mang Ling Ada Fok, Jialu Ma, Yan Xia, Daniel Cremers, Philip Torr, Volker Tresp, Jindong Gu | Localizing events in videos based on semantic queries is a pivotal task in video understanding, with the growing significance of user-oriented applications like video search. Yet, current research predominantly relies on natural language queries (NLQs), overlooking the potential of using multimodal queries (MQs) that integrate images to more flexibly represent semantic queries -- especially when it is difficult to express non-verbal or unfamiliar concepts in words. To bridge this gap, we introduce ICQ, a new benchmark designed for localizing events in videos with MQs, alongside an evaluation dataset ICQ-Highlight. To accommodate and evaluate existing video localization models for this new task, we propose 3 Multimodal Query Adaptation methods and a novel Surrogate Fine-tuning on pseudo-MQs strategy. ICQ systematically benchmarks 12 state-of-the-art backbone models, spanning from specialized video localization models to Video LLMs, across diverse application domains. Our experiments highlight the high potential of MQs in real-world applications. We believe this benchmark is a first step toward advancing MQs in video event localization. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.10079v3) | N/A |
| SpectroMotion: Dynamic 3D Reconstruction of Specular Scenes | Cheng-De Fan, Chen-Wei Chang, Yi-Ruei Liu, Jie-Ying Lee, Jiun-Long Huang, Yu-Chee Tseng, Yu-Lun Liu | We present SpectroMotion, a novel approach that combines 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with physically-based rendering (PBR) and deformation fields to reconstruct dynamic specular scenes. Previous methods extending 3DGS to model dynamic scenes have struggled to represent specular surfaces accurately. Our method addresses this limitation by introducing a residual correction technique for accurate surface normal computation during deformation, complemented by a deformable environment map that adapts to time-varying lighting conditions. We implement a coarse-to-fine training strategy that significantly enhances scene geometry and specular color prediction. It is the only existing 3DGS method capable of synthesizing photorealistic real-world dynamic specular scenes, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in rendering complex, dynamic, and specular scenes.

| LUCAS: Layered Universal Codec Avatars | Di Liu, Teng Deng, Giljoo Nam, Yu Rong, Stanislav Pidhorskyi, Junxuan Li, Jason Saragih, Dimitris N. Metaxas, Chen Cao | Photorealistic 3D head avatar reconstruction faces critical challenges in modeling dynamic face-hair interactions and achieving cross-identity generalization, particularly during expressions and head movements. We present LUCAS, a novel Universal Prior Model (UPM) for codec avatar modeling that disentangles face and hair through a layered representation. Unlike previous UPMs that treat hair as an integral part of the head, our approach separates the modeling of the hairless head and hair into distinct branches. LUCAS is the first to introduce a mesh-based UPM, facilitating real-time rendering on devices. Our layered representation also improves the anchor geometry for precise and visually appealing Gaussian renderings. Experimental results indicate that LUCAS outperforms existing single-mesh and Gaussian-based avatar models in both quantitative and qualitative assessments, including evaluations on held-out subjects in zero-shot driving scenarios. LUCAS demonstrates superior dynamic performance in managing head pose changes, expression transfer, and hairstyle variations, thereby advancing the state-of-the-art in 3D head avatar reconstruction. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.19739v1) | N/A |
| HyperGLM: HyperGraph for Video Scene Graph Generation and Anticipation | Trong-Thuan Nguyen, Pha Nguyen, Jackson Cothren, Alper Yilmaz, Khoa Luu | Multimodal LLMs have advanced vision-language tasks but still struggle with understanding video scenes. To bridge this gap, Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) has emerged to capture multi-object relationships across video frames. However, prior methods rely on pairwise connections, limiting their ability to handle complex multi-object interactions and reasoning. To this end, we propose Multimodal LLMs on a Scene HyperGraph (HyperGLM), promoting reasoning about multi-way interactions and higher-order relationships. Our approach uniquely integrates entity scene graphs, which capture spatial relationships between objects, with a procedural graph that models their causal transitions, forming a unified HyperGraph. Significantly, HyperGLM enables reasoning by injecting this unified HyperGraph into LLMs. Additionally, we introduce a new Video Scene Graph Reasoning (VSGR) dataset featuring 1.9M frames from third-person, egocentric, and drone views and supports five tasks: Scene Graph Generation, Scene Graph Anticipation, Video Question Answering, Video Captioning, and Relation Reasoning. Empirically, HyperGLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across five tasks, effectively modeling and reasoning complex relationships in diverse video scenes. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18042v1) | N/A |
| DSPNet: Dual-vision Scene Perception for Robust 3D Question Answering | Jingzhou Luo, Yang Liu, Weixing Chen, Zhen Li, Yaowei Wang, Guanbin Li, Liang Lin | 3D Question Answering (3D QA) requires the model to comprehensively understand its situated 3D scene described by the text, then reason about its surrounding environment and answer a question under that situation. However, existing methods usually rely on global scene perception from pure 3D point clouds and overlook the importance of rich local texture details from multi-view images. Moreover, due to the inherent noise in camera poses and complex occlusions, there exists significant feature degradation and reduced feature robustness problems when aligning 3D point cloud with multi-view images. In this paper, we propose a Dual-vision Scene Perception Network (DSPNet), to comprehensively integrate multi-view and point cloud features to improve robustness in 3D QA. Our Text-guided Multi-view Fusion (TGMF) module prioritizes image views that closely match the semantic content of the text. To adaptively fuse back-projected multi-view images with point cloud features, we design the Adaptive Dual-vision Perception (ADVP) module, enhancing 3D scene comprehension. Additionally, our Multimodal Context-guided Reasoning (MCGR) module facilitates robust reasoning by integrating contextual information across visual and linguistic modalities. Experimental results on SQA3D and ScanQA datasets demonstrate the superiority of our DSPNet.

First, we present a large-scale dataset comprising 360K video-music pairs, including various genres such as movie trailers, advertisements, and documentaries. Furthermore, we propose VidMuse, a simple framework for generating music aligned with video inputs. VidMuse stands out by producing high-fidelity music that is both acoustically and semantically aligned with the video. By incorporating local and global visual cues, VidMuse enables the creation of musically coherent audio tracks that consistently match the video content through Long-Short-Term modeling.

| Learning Visual Composition through Improved Semantic Guidance | Austin Stone, Hagen Soltau, Robert Geirhos, Xi Yi, Ye Xia, Bingyi Cao, Kaifeng Chen, Abhijit Ogale, Jonathon Shlens | Visual imagery does not consist of solitary objects, but instead reflects the composition of a multitude of fluid concepts. While there have been great advances in visual representation learning, such advances have focused on building better representations for a small number of discrete objects bereft of an understanding of how these objects are interacting. One can observe this limitation in representations learned through captions or contrastive learning -- where the learned model treats an image essentially as a bag of words. Several works have attempted to address this limitation through the development of bespoke learned architectures to directly address the shortcomings in compositional learning. In this work, we focus on simple, and scalable approaches. In particular, we demonstrate that by substantially improving weakly labeled data, i.e. captions, we can vastly improve the performance of standard contrastive learning approaches. Previous CLIP models achieved near chance rate on challenging tasks probing compositional learning. However, our simple approach boosts performance of CLIP substantially and surpasses all bespoke architectures. Furthermore, we showcase our results on a relatively new captioning benchmark derived from DOCCI. We demonstrate through a series of ablations that a standard CLIP model trained with enhanced data may demonstrate impressive performance on image retrieval tasks. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15396v1) | N/A |
| Interpreting Object-level Foundation Models via Visual Precision Search | Ruoyu Chen, Siyuan Liang, Jingzhi Li, Shiming Liu, Maosen Li, Zheng Huang, Hua Zhang, Xiaochun Cao | Advances in multimodal pre-training have propelled object-level foundation models, such as Grounding DINO and Florence-2, in tasks like visual grounding and object detection. However, interpreting these models\' decisions has grown increasingly challenging. Existing interpretable attribution methods for object-level task interpretation have notable limitations: (1) gradient-based methods lack precise localization due to visual-textual fusion in foundation models, and (2) perturbation-based methods produce noisy saliency maps, limiting fine-grained interpretability. To address these, we propose a Visual Precision Search method that generates accurate attribution maps with fewer regions. Our method bypasses internal model parameters to overcome attribution issues from multimodal fusion, dividing inputs into sparse sub-regions and using consistency and collaboration scores to accurately identify critical decision-making regions. We also conducted a theoretical analysis of the boundary guarantees and scope of applicability of our method. Experiments on RefCOCO, MS COCO, and LVIS show our approach enhances object-level task interpretability over SOTA for Grounding DINO and Florence-2 across various evaluation metrics, with faithfulness gains of 23.7\%, 31.6\%, and 20.1\% on MS COCO, LVIS, and RefCOCO for Grounding DINO, and 102.9\% and 66.9\% on MS COCO and RefCOCO for Florence-2. Additionally, our method can interpret failures in visual grounding and object detection tasks, surpassing existing methods across multiple evaluation metrics.

| SVFR: A Unified Framework for Generalized Video Face Restoration | Zhiyao Wang, Xu Chen, Chengming Xu, Junwei Zhu, Xiaobin Hu, Jiangning Zhang, Chengjie Wang, Yuqi Liu, Yiyi Zhou, Rongrong Ji | Face Restoration (FR) is a crucial area within image and video processing, focusing on reconstructing high-quality portraits from degraded inputs. Despite advancements in image FR, video FR remains relatively under-explored, primarily due to challenges related to temporal consistency, motion artifacts, and the limited availability of high-quality video data. Moreover, traditional face restoration typically prioritizes enhancing resolution and may not give as much consideration to related tasks such as facial colorization and inpainting. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the Generalized Video Face Restoration (GVFR) task, which integrates video BFR, inpainting, and colorization tasks that we empirically show to benefit each other. We present a unified framework, termed as stable video face restoration (SVFR), which leverages the generative and motion priors of Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) and incorporates task-specific information through a unified face restoration framework. A learnable task embedding is introduced to enhance task identification. Meanwhile, a novel Unified Latent Regularization (ULR) is employed to encourage the shared feature representation learning among different subtasks. To further enhance the restoration quality and temporal stability, we introduce the facial prior learning and the self-referred refinement as auxiliary strategies used for both training and inference. The proposed framework effectively combines the complementary strengths of these tasks, enhancing temporal coherence and achieving superior restoration quality. This work advances the state-of-the-art in video FR and establishes a new paradigm for generalized video face restoration.

| SceneTAP: Scene-Coherent Typographic Adversarial Planner against Vision-Language Models in Real-World Environments | Yue Cao, Yun Xing, Jie Zhang, Di Lin, Tianwei Zhang, Ivor Tsang, Yang Liu, Qing Guo | Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in interpreting visual content. While existing works demonstrate these models' vulnerability to deliberately placed adversarial texts, such texts are often easily identifiable as anomalous. In this paper, we present the first approach to generate scene-coherent typographic adversarial attacks that mislead advanced LVLMs while maintaining visual naturalness through the capability of the LLM-based agent. Our approach addresses three critical questions: what adversarial text to generate, where to place it within the scene, and how to integrate it seamlessly. We propose a training-free, multi-modal LLM-driven scene-coherent typographic adversarial planning (SceneTAP) that employs a three-stage process: scene understanding, adversarial planning, and seamless integration. The SceneTAP utilizes chain-of-thought reasoning to comprehend the scene, formulate effective adversarial text, strategically plan its placement, and provide detailed instructions for natural integration within the image. This is followed by a scene-coherent TextDiffuser that executes the attack using a local diffusion mechanism. We extend our method to real-world scenarios by printing and placing generated patches in physical environments, demonstrating its practical implications. Extensive experiments show that our scene-coherent adversarial text successfully misleads state-of-the-art LVLMs, including ChatGPT-4o, even after capturing new images of physical setups. Our evaluations demonstrate a significant increase in attack success rates while maintaining visual naturalness and contextual appropriateness. This work highlights vulnerabilities in current vision-language models to sophisticated, scene-coherent adversarial attacks and provides insights into potential defense mechanisms. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.00114v1) | N/A |

However, DiT models have faced challenges with quadratic complexity efficiency, especially when handling long sequences. In this paper, we aim to incorporate the sub-quadratic modeling capability of Gated Linear Attention (GLA) into the 2D diffusion backbone. Specifically, we introduce Diffusion Gated Linear Attention Transformers (DiG), a simple, adoptable solution with minimal parameter overhead. We offer two variants, i,e, a plain and U-shape architecture, showing superior efficiency and competitive effectiveness. In addition to superior performance to DiT and other sub-quadratic-time diffusion models at $256 \times 256$ resolution, DiG demonstrates greater efficiency than these methods starting from a $512$ resolution. Specifically, DiG-S/2 is $2.5\times$ faster and saves $75.7\%$ GPU memory compared to DiT-S/2 at a $1792$ resolution. Additionally, DiG-XL/2 is $4.2\times$ faster than the Mamba-based model at a $1024$ resolution and $1.8\times$ faster than DiT with FlashAttention-2 at a $2048$ resolution.

| Universal Actions for Enhanced Embodied Foundation Models | Jinliang Zheng, Jianxiong Li, Dongxiu Liu, Yinan Zheng, Zhihao Wang, Zhonghong Ou, Yu Liu, Jingjing Liu, Ya-Qin Zhang, Xianyuan Zhan | Training on diverse, internet-scale data is a key factor in the success of recent large foundation models. Yet, using the same recipe for building embodied agents has faced noticeable difficulties. Despite the availability of many crowd-sourced embodied datasets, their action spaces often exhibit significant heterogeneity due to distinct physical embodiment and control interfaces for different robots, causing substantial challenges in developing embodied foundation models using cross-domain data. In this paper, we introduce UniAct, a new embodied foundation modeling framework operating in a tokenized Universal Action Space. Our learned universal actions capture the generic atomic behaviors across diverse robots by exploiting their shared structural features, and enable enhanced cross-domain data utilization and cross-embodiment generalizations by eliminating the notorious heterogeneity. The universal actions can be efficiently translated back to heterogeneous actionable commands by simply adding embodiment-specific details, from which fast adaptation to new robots becomes simple and straightforward.

| Any3DIS: Class-Agnostic 3D Instance Segmentation by 2D Mask Tracking | Phuc Nguyen, Minh Luu, Anh Tran, Cuong Pham, Khoi Nguyen | Existing 3D instance segmentation methods frequently encounter issues with over-segmentation, leading to redundant and inaccurate 3D proposals that complicate downstream tasks. This challenge arises from their unsupervised merging approach, where dense 2D instance masks are lifted across frames into point clouds to form 3D candidate proposals without direct supervision. These candidates are then hierarchically merged based on heuristic criteria, often resulting in numerous redundant segments that fail to combine into precise 3D proposals. To overcome these limitations, we propose a 3D-Aware 2D Mask Tracking module that uses robust 3D priors from a 2D mask segmentation and tracking foundation model (SAM-2) to ensure consistent object masks across video frames. Rather than merging all visible superpoints across views to create a 3D mask, our 3D Mask Optimization module leverages a dynamic programming algorithm to select an optimal set of views, refining the superpoints to produce a final 3D proposal for each object. Our approach achieves comprehensive object coverage within the scene while reducing unnecessary proposals, which could otherwise impair downstream applications. Evaluations on ScanNet200 and ScanNet++ confirm the effectiveness of our method, with improvements across Class-Agnostic, Open-Vocabulary, and Open-Ended 3D Instance Segmentation tasks. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16183v1) | N/A |
| Decoupling Fine Detail and Global Geometry for Compressed Depth Map Super-Resolution | Huan Zheng, Wencheng Han, Jianbing Shen | Recovering high-quality depth maps from compressed sources has gained significant attention due to the limitations of consumer-grade depth cameras and the bandwidth restrictions during data transmission. However, current methods still suffer from two challenges. First, bit-depth compression produces a uniform depth representation in regions with subtle variations, hindering the recovery of detailed information. Second, densely distributed random noise reduces the accuracy of estimating the global geometric structure of the scene. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, termed geometry-decoupled network (GDNet), for compressed depth map super-resolution that decouples the high-quality depth map reconstruction process by handling global and detailed geometric features separately. To be specific, we propose the fine geometry detail encoder (FGDE), which is designed to aggregate fine geometry details in high-resolution low-level image features while simultaneously enriching them with complementary information from low-resolution context-level image features. In addition, we develop the global geometry encoder (GGE) that aims at suppressing noise and extracting global geometric information effectively via constructing compact feature representation in a low-rank space. We conduct experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating that our GDNet significantly outperforms current methods in terms of geometric consistency and detail recovery. In the ECCV 2024 AIM Compressed Depth Upsampling Challenge, our solution won the 1st place award. Our codes will be available. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.03239v2) | N/A |
| Nested Diffusion Models Using Hierarchical Latent Priors | Xiao Zhang, Ruoxi Jiang, Rebecca Willett, Michael Maire | We introduce nested diffusion models, an efficient and powerful hierarchical generative framework that substantially enhances the generation quality of diffusion models, particularly for images of complex scenes. Our approach employs a series of diffusion models to progressively generate latent variables at different semantic levels. Each model in this series is conditioned on the output of the preceding higher-level models, culminating in image generation. Hierarchical latent variables guide the generation process along predefined semantic pathways, allowing our approach to capture intricate structural details while significantly improving image quality. To construct these latent variables, we leverage a pre-trained visual encoder, which learns strong semantic visual representations, and modulate its capacity via dimensionality reduction and noise injection. Across multiple datasets, our system demonstrates significant enhancements in image quality for both unconditional and class/text conditional generation. Moreover, our unconditional generation system substantially outperforms the baseline conditional system. These advancements incur minimal computational overhead as the more abstract levels of our hierarchy work with lower-dimensional representations. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05984v1) | N/A |
| Blurred LiDAR for Sharper 3D: Robust Handheld 3D Scanning with Diffuse LiDAR and RGB | Nikhil Behari, Aaron Young, Siddharth Somasundaram, Tzofi Klinghoffer, Akshat Dave, Ramesh Raskar | 3D surface reconstruction is essential across applications of virtual reality, robotics, and mobile scanning. However, RGB-based reconstruction often fails in low-texture, low-light, and low-albedo scenes. Handheld LiDARs, now common on mobile devices, aim to address these challenges by capturing depth information from time-of-flight measurements of a coarse grid of projected dots. Yet, these sparse LiDARs struggle with scene coverage on limited input views, leaving large gaps in depth information. In this work, we propose using an alternative class of "blurred" LiDAR that emits a diffuse flash, greatly improving scene coverage but introducing spatial ambiguity from mixed time-of-flight measurements across a wide field of view. To handle these ambiguities, we propose leveraging the complementary strengths of diffuse LiDAR with RGB. We introduce a Gaussian surfel-based rendering framework with a scene-adaptive loss function that dynamically balances RGB and diffuse LiDAR signals. We demonstrate that, surprisingly, diffuse LiDAR can outperform traditional sparse LiDAR, enabling robust 3D scanning with accurate color and geometry estimation in challenging environments. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.19474v1) | N/A |
| SeqAfford: Sequential 3D Affordance Reasoning via Multimodal Large Language Model | Chunlin Yu, Hanqing Wang, Ye Shi, Haoyang Luo, Sibei Yang, Jingyi Yu, Jingya Wang | 3D affordance segmentation aims to link human instructions to touchable regions of 3D objects for embodied manipulations. Existing efforts typically adhere to single-object, single-affordance paradigms, where each affordance type or explicit instruction strictly corresponds to a specific affordance region and are unable to handle long-horizon tasks. Such a paradigm cannot actively reason about complex user intentions that often imply sequential affordances. In this paper, we introduce the Sequential 3D Affordance Reasoning task, which extends the traditional paradigm by reasoning from cumbersome user intentions and then decomposing them into a series of segmentation maps. Toward this, we construct the first instruction-based affordance segmentation benchmark that includes reasoning over both single and sequential affordances, comprising 180K instruction-point cloud pairs. Based on the benchmark, we propose our model, SeqAfford, to unlock the 3D multi-modal large language model with additional affordance segmentation abilities, which ensures reasoning with world knowledge and fine-grained affordance grounding in a cohesive framework. We further introduce a multi-granular language-point integration module to endow 3D dense prediction. Extensive experimental evaluations show that our model excels over well-established methods and exhibits open-world generalization with sequential reasoning abilities. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01550v2) | N/A |
| Do ImageNet-trained models learn shortcuts? The impact of frequency shortcuts on generalization | Shunxin Wang, Raymond Veldhuis, Nicola Strisciuglio | Frequency shortcuts refer to specific frequency patterns that models heavily rely on for correct classification. Previous studies have shown that models trained on small image datasets often exploit such shortcuts, potentially impairing their generalization performance. However, existing methods for identifying frequency shortcuts require expensive computations and become impractical for analyzing models trained on large datasets. In this work, we propose the first approach to more efficiently analyze frequency shortcuts at a larger scale. We show that both CNN and transformer models learn frequency shortcuts on ImageNet. We also expose that frequency shortcut solutions can yield good performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets which largely retain texture information. However, these shortcuts, mostly aligned with texture patterns, hinder model generalization on rendition-based OOD test sets. These observations suggest that current OOD evaluations often overlook the impact of frequency shortcuts on model generalization. Future benchmarks could thus benefit from explicitly assessing and accounting for these shortcuts to build models that generalize across a broader range of OOD scenarios. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.03519v1) | N/A |
| PartGen: Part-level 3D Generation and Reconstruction with Multi-View Diffusion Models | Minghao Chen, Roman Shapovalov, Iro Laina, Tom Monnier, Jianyuan Wang, David Novotny, Andrea Vedaldi | Text- or image-to-3D generators and 3D scanners can now produce 3D assets with high-quality shapes and textures. These assets typically consist of a single, fused representation, like an implicit neural field, a Gaussian mixture, or a mesh, without any useful structure. However, most applications and creative workflows require assets to be made of several meaningful parts that can be manipulated independently. To address this gap, we introduce PartGen, a novel approach that generates 3D objects composed of meaningful parts starting from text, an image, or an unstructured 3D object. First, given multiple views of a 3D object, generated or rendered, a multi-view diffusion model extracts a set of plausible and view-consistent part segmentations, dividing the object into parts. Then, a second multi-view diffusion model takes each part separately, fills in the occlusions, and uses those completed views for 3D reconstruction by feeding them to a 3D reconstruction network. This completion process considers the context of the entire object to ensure that the parts integrate cohesively. The generative completion model can make up for the information missing due to occlusions; in extreme cases, it can hallucinate entirely invisible parts based on the input 3D asset. We evaluate our method on generated and real 3D assets and show that it outperforms segmentation and part-extraction baselines by a large margin. We also showcase downstream applications such as 3D part editing. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18608v2) | N/A |
| Pattern Analogies: Learning to Perform Programmatic Image Edits by Analogy | Aditya Ganeshan, Thibault Groueix, Paul Guerrero, Radomír Měch, Matthew Fisher, Daniel Ritchie | Pattern images are everywhere in the digital and physical worlds, and tools to edit them are valuable. But editing pattern images is tricky: desired edits are often programmatic: structure-aware edits that alter the underlying program which generates the pattern. One could attempt to infer this underlying program, but current methods for doing so struggle with complex images and produce unorganized programs that make editing tedious. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to perform programmatic edits on pattern images. By using a pattern analogy -- a pair of simple patterns to demonstrate the intended edit -- and a learning-based generative model to execute these edits, our method allows users to intuitively edit patterns. To enable this paradigm, we introduce SplitWeave, a domain-specific language that, combined with a framework for sampling synthetic pattern analogies, enables the creation of a large, high-quality synthetic training dataset. We also present TriFuser, a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) designed to overcome critical issues that arise when naively deploying LDMs to this task. Extensive experiments on real-world, artist-sourced patterns reveals that our method faithfully performs the demonstrated edit while also generalizing to related pattern styles beyond its training distribution. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12463v1) | N/A |
| MANTA: Diffusion Mamba for Efficient and Effective Stochastic Long-Term Dense Anticipation | Olga Zatsarynna, Emad Bahrami, Yazan Abu Farha, Gianpiero Francesca, Juergen Gall | Our work addresses the problem of stochastic long-term dense anticipation. The goal of this task is to predict actions and their durations several minutes into the future based on provided video observations. Anticipation over extended horizons introduces high uncertainty, as a single observation can lead to multiple plausible future outcomes. To address this uncertainty, stochastic models are designed to predict several potential future action sequences. Recent work has further proposed to incorporate uncertainty modelling for observed frames by simultaneously predicting per-frame past and future actions in a unified manner. While such joint modelling of actions is beneficial, it requires long-range temporal capabilities to connect events across distant past and future time points. However, the previous work struggles to achieve such a long-range understanding due to its limited and/or sparse receptive field. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel MANTA (MAmba for ANTicipation) network. Our model enables effective long-term temporal modelling even for very long sequences while maintaining linear complexity in sequence length. We demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on three datasets - Breakfast, 50Salads, and Assembly101 - while also significantly improving computational and memory efficiency. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08837v1) | N/A |
| Towards Realistic Example-based Modeling via 3D Gaussian Stitching | Xinyu Gao, Ziyi Yang, Bingchen Gong, Xiaoguang Han, Sipeng Yang, Xiaogang Jin | Using parts of existing models to rebuild new models, commonly termed as example-based modeling, is a classical methodology in the realm of computer graphics. Previous works mostly focus on shape composition, making them very hard to use for realistic composition of 3D objects captured from real-world scenes. This leads to combining multiple NeRFs into a single 3D scene to achieve seamless appearance blending. However, the current SeamlessNeRF method struggles to achieve interactive editing and harmonious stitching for real-world scenes due to its gradient-based strategy and grid-based representation. To this end, we present an example-based modeling method that combines multiple Gaussian fields in a point-based representation using sample-guided synthesis. Specifically, as for composition, we create a GUI to segment and transform multiple fields in real time, easily obtaining a semantically meaningful composition of models represented by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). For texture blending, due to the discrete and irregular nature of 3DGS, straightforwardly applying gradient propagation as SeamlssNeRF is not supported. Thus, a novel sampling-based cloning method is proposed to harmonize the blending while preserving the original rich texture and content. Our workflow consists of three steps: 1) real-time segmentation and transformation of a Gaussian model using a well-tailored GUI, 2) KNN analysis to identify boundary points in the intersecting area between the source and target models, and 3) two-phase optimization of the target model using sampling-based cloning and gradient constraints. Extensive experimental results validate that our approach significantly outperforms previous works in terms of realistic synthesis, demonstrating its practicality.

| Vid2Sim: Realistic and Interactive Simulation from Video for Urban Navigation | Ziyang Xie, Zhizheng Liu, Zhenghao Peng, Wayne Wu, Bolei Zhou | Sim-to-real gap has long posed a significant challenge for robot learning in simulation, preventing the deployment of learned models in the real world. Previous work has primarily focused on domain randomization and system identification to mitigate this gap. However, these methods are often limited by the inherent constraints of the simulation and graphics engines. In this work, we propose Vid2Sim, a novel framework that effectively bridges the sim2real gap through a scalable and cost-efficient real2sim pipeline for neural 3D scene reconstruction and simulation. Given a monocular video as input, Vid2Sim can generate photorealistic and physically interactable 3D simulation environments to enable the reinforcement learning of visual navigation agents in complex urban environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Vid2Sim significantly improves the performance of urban navigation in the digital twins and real world by 31.2% and 68.3% in success rate compared with agents trained with prior simulation methods. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.06693v2) | [https://metadriverse.github.io/vid2sim](https://metadriverse.github.io/vid2sim) |
| Conditional Balance: Improving Multi-Conditioning Trade-Offs in Image Generation | Nadav Z. Cohen, Oron Nir, Ariel Shamir | Balancing content fidelity and artistic style is a pivotal challenge in image generation. While traditional style transfer methods and modern Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) strive to achieve this balance, they often struggle to do so without sacrificing either style, content, or sometimes both. This work addresses this challenge by analyzing the ability of DDPMs to maintain content and style equilibrium. We introduce a novel method to identify sensitivities within the DDPM attention layers, identifying specific layers that correspond to different stylistic aspects. By directing conditional inputs only to these sensitive layers, our approach enables fine-grained control over style and content, significantly reducing issues arising from over-constrained inputs. Our findings demonstrate that this method enhances recent stylization techniques by better aligning style and content, ultimately improving the quality of generated visual content. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19853v1) | N/A |
| ExpertAF: Expert Actionable Feedback from Video | Kumar Ashutosh, Tushar Nagarajan, Georgios Pavlakos, Kris Kitani, Kristen Grauman | Feedback is essential for learning a new skill or improving one's current skill-level. However, current methods for skill-assessment from video only provide scores or compare demonstrations, leaving the burden of knowing what to do differently on the user. We introduce a novel method to generate actionable feedback from video of a person doing a physical activity, such as basketball or soccer. Our method takes a video demonstration and its accompanying 3D body pose and generates (1) free-form expert commentary describing what the person is doing well and what they could improve, and (2) a visual expert demonstration that incorporates the required corrections. We show how to leverage Ego-Exo4D's videos of skilled activity and expert commentary together with a strong language model to create a weakly-supervised training dataset for this task, and we devise a multimodal video-language model to infer coaching feedback. Our method is able to reason across multi-modal input combinations to output full-spectrum, actionable coaching -- expert commentary, expert video retrieval, and expert pose generation -- outperforming strong vision-language models on both established metrics and human preference studies. Code and data will be publicly released. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00672v2) | N/A |
| SpatialDreamer: Self-supervised Stereo Video Synthesis from Monocular Input | Zhen Lv, Yangqi Long, Congzhentao Huang, Cao Li, Chengfei Lv, Hao Ren, Dian Zheng | Stereo video synthesis from a monocular input is a demanding task in the fields of spatial computing and virtual reality. The main challenges of this task lie on the insufficiency of high-quality paired stereo videos for training and the difficulty of maintaining the spatio-temporal consistency between frames. Existing methods primarily address these issues by directly applying novel view synthesis (NVS) techniques to video, while facing limitations such as the inability to effectively represent dynamic scenes and the requirement for large amounts of training data. In this paper, we introduce a novel self-supervised stereo video synthesis paradigm via a video diffusion model, termed SpatialDreamer, which meets the challenges head-on. Firstly, to address the stereo video data insufficiency, we propose a Depth based Video Generation module DVG, which employs a forward-backward rendering mechanism to generate paired videos with geometric and temporal priors. Leveraging data generated by DVG, we propose RefinerNet along with a self-supervised synthetic framework designed to facilitate efficient and dedicated training. More importantly, we devise a consistency control module, which consists of a metric of stereo deviation strength and a Temporal Interaction Learning module TIL for geometric and temporal consistency ensurance respectively. We evaluated the proposed method against various benchmark methods, with the results showcasing its superior performance. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.11934v1) | [https://github.com/thygate/stable-diffusion-webui-depthmap-script](https://github.com/thygate/stable-diffusion-webui-depthmap-script) |
| HaWoR: World-Space Hand Motion Reconstruction from Egocentric Videos | Jinglei Zhang, Jiankang Deng, Chao Ma, Rolandos Alexandros Potamias | Despite the advent in 3D hand pose estimation, current methods predominantly focus on single-image 3D hand reconstruction in the camera frame, overlooking the world-space motion of the hands. Such limitation prohibits their direct use in egocentric video settings, where hands and camera are continuously in motion. In this work, we propose HaWoR, a high-fidelity method for hand motion reconstruction in world coordinates from egocentric videos. We propose to decouple the task by reconstructing the hand motion in the camera space and estimating the camera trajectory in the world coordinate system. To achieve precise camera trajectory estimation, we propose an adaptive egocentric SLAM framework that addresses the shortcomings of traditional SLAM methods, providing robust performance under challenging camera dynamics. To ensure robust hand motion trajectories, even when the hands move out of view frustum, we devise a novel motion infiller network that effectively completes the missing frames of the sequence. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that HaWoR achieves state-of-the-art performance on both hand motion reconstruction and world-frame camera trajectory estimation under different egocentric benchmark datasets.

| Track4Gen: Teaching Video Diffusion Models to Track Points Improves Video Generation | Hyeonho Jeong, Chun-Hao Paul Huang, Jong Chul Ye, Niloy Mitra, Duygu Ceylan | While recent foundational video generators produce visually rich output, they still struggle with appearance drift, where objects gradually degrade or change inconsistently across frames, breaking visual coherence. We hypothesize that this is because there is no explicit supervision in terms of spatial tracking at the feature level. We propose Track4Gen, a spatially aware video generator that combines video diffusion loss with point tracking across frames, providing enhanced spatial supervision on the diffusion features. Track4Gen merges the video generation and point tracking tasks into a single network by making minimal changes to existing video generation architectures. Using Stable Video Diffusion as a backbone, Track4Gen demonstrates that it is possible to unify video generation and point tracking, which are typically handled as separate tasks. Our extensive evaluations show that Track4Gen effectively reduces appearance drift, resulting in temporally stable and visually coherent video generation.

| Enhancing 3D Gaze Estimation in the Wild using Weak Supervision with Gaze Following Labels | Pierre Vuillecard, Jean-Marc Odobez | Accurate 3D gaze estimation in unconstrained real-world environments remains a significant challenge due to variations in appearance, head pose, occlusion, and the limited availability of in-the-wild 3D gaze datasets. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel Self-Training Weakly-Supervised Gaze Estimation framework (ST-WSGE). This two-stage learning framework leverages diverse 2D gaze datasets, such as gaze-following data, which offer rich variations in appearances, natural scenes, and gaze distributions, and proposes an approach to generate 3D pseudo-labels and enhance model generalization. Furthermore, traditional modality-specific models, designed separately for images or videos, limit the effective use of available training data. To overcome this, we propose the Gaze Transformer (GaT), a modality-agnostic architecture capable of simultaneously learning static and dynamic gaze information from both image and video datasets. By combining 3D video datasets with 2D gaze target labels from gaze following tasks, our approach achieves the following key contributions: (i) Significant state-of-the-art improvements in within-domain and cross-domain generalization on unconstrained benchmarks like Gaze360 and GFIE, with notable cross-modal gains in video gaze estimation; (ii) Superior cross-domain performance on datasets such as MPIIFaceGaze and Gaze360 compared to frontal face methods. Code and pre-trained models will be released to the community. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.20249v1) | [https://github.com/zhangda1018/yolov5-crowdhuman](https://github.com/zhangda1018/yolov5-crowdhuman) |
| MambaOut: Do We Really Need Mamba for Vision? | Weihao Yu, Xinchao Wang | Mamba, an architecture with RNN-like token mixer of state space model (SSM), was recently introduced to address the quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism and subsequently applied to vision tasks. Nevertheless, the performance of Mamba for vision is often underwhelming when compared with convolutional and attention-based models. In this paper, we delve into the essence of Mamba, and conceptually conclude that Mamba is ideally suited for tasks with long-sequence and autoregressive characteristics. For vision tasks, as image classification does not align with either characteristic, we hypothesize that Mamba is not necessary for this task; Detection and segmentation tasks are also not autoregressive, yet they adhere to the long-sequence characteristic, so we believe it is still worthwhile to explore Mamba's potential for these tasks. To empirically verify our hypotheses, we construct a series of models named MambaOut through stacking Mamba blocks while removing their core token mixer, SSM. Experimental results strongly support our hypotheses. Specifically, our MambaOut model surpasses all visual Mamba models on ImageNet image classification, indicating that Mamba is indeed unnecessary for this task. As for detection and segmentation, MambaOut cannot match the performance of state-of-the-art visual Mamba models, demonstrating the potential of Mamba for long-sequence visual tasks.

| Efficient Visual State Space Model for Image Deblurring | Lingshun Kong, Jiangxin Dong, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Jinshan Pan | Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved excellent performance in image restoration. ViTs typically yield superior results in image restoration compared to CNNs due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies and input-dependent characteristics. However, the computational complexity of Transformer-based models grows quadratically with the image resolution, limiting their practical appeal in high-resolution image restoration tasks. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective visual state space model (EVSSM) for image deblurring, leveraging the benefits of state space models (SSMs) to visual data. In contrast to existing methods that employ several fixed-direction scanning for feature extraction, which significantly increases the computational cost, we develop an efficient visual scan block that applies various geometric transformations before each SSM-based module, capturing useful non-local information and maintaining high efficiency. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed EVSSM performs favorably against state-of-the-art image deblurring methods on benchmark datasets and real-captured images. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.14343v1) | [https://github.com/kkkls/EVSSM](https://github.com/kkkls/EVSSM) |
| EgoLM: Multi-Modal Language Model of Egocentric Motions | Fangzhou Hong, Vladimir Guzov, Hyo Jin Kim, Yuting Ye, Richard Newcombe, Ziwei Liu, Lingni Ma | As the prevalence of wearable devices, learning egocentric motions becomes essential to develop contextual AI. In this work, we present EgoLM, a versatile framework that tracks and understands egocentric motions from multi-modal inputs, e.g., egocentric videos and motion sensors. EgoLM exploits rich contexts for the disambiguation of egomotion tracking and understanding, which are ill-posed under single modality conditions. To facilitate the versatile and multi-modal framework, our key insight is to model the joint distribution of egocentric motions and natural languages using large language models (LLM). Multi-modal sensor inputs are encoded and projected to the joint latent space of language models, and used to prompt motion generation or text generation for egomotion tracking or understanding, respectively. Extensive experiments on large-scale multi-modal human motion dataset validate the effectiveness of EgoLM as a generalist model for universal egocentric learning. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18127v1) | [https://hongfz16.github.io/projects](https://hongfz16.github.io/projects), [https://hongfz16.github.io/projects](https://hongfz16.github.io/projects) |
| Diffusion Self-Distillation for Zero-Shot Customized Image Generation | Shengqu Cai, Eric Chan, Yunzhi Zhang, Leonidas Guibas, Jiajun Wu, Gordon Wetzstein | Text-to-image diffusion models produce impressive results but are frustrating tools for artists who desire fine-grained control. For example, a common use case is to create images of a specific instance in novel contexts, i.e., "identity-preserving generation". This setting, along with many other tasks (e.g., relighting), is a natural fit for image+text-conditional generative models. However, there is insufficient high-quality paired data to train such a model directly. We propose Diffusion Self-Distillation, a method for using a pre-trained text-to-image model to generate its own dataset for text-conditioned image-to-image tasks. We first leverage a text-to-image diffusion model's in-context generation ability to create grids of images and curate a large paired dataset with the help of a Visual-Language Model. We then fine-tune the text-to-image model into a text+image-to-image model using the curated paired dataset. We demonstrate that Diffusion Self-Distillation outperforms existing zero-shot methods and is competitive with per-instance tuning techniques on a wide range of identity-preservation generation tasks, without requiring test-time optimization. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18616v1) | N/A |
| MeshArt: Generating Articulated Meshes with Structure-guided Transformers | Daoyi Gao, Yawar Siddiqui, Lei Li, Angela Dai | Articulated 3D object generation is fundamental for creating realistic, functional, and interactable virtual assets which are not simply static. We introduce MeshArt, a hierarchical transformer-based approach to generate articulated 3D meshes with clean, compact geometry, reminiscent of human-crafted 3D models. We approach articulated mesh generation in a part-by-part fashion across two stages. First, we generate a high-level articulation-aware object structure; then, based on this structural information, we synthesize each part's mesh faces. Key to our approach is modeling both articulation structures and part meshes as sequences of quantized triangle embeddings, leading to a unified hierarchical framework with transformers for autoregressive generation. Object part structures are first generated as their bounding primitives and articulation modes; a second transformer, guided by these articulation structures, then generates each part's mesh triangles. To ensure coherency among generated parts, we introduce structure-guided conditioning that also incorporates local part mesh connectivity. MeshArt shows significant improvements over state of the art, with 57.1% improvement in structure coverage and a 209-point improvement in mesh generation FID. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11596v1) | N/A |
| FedMIA: An Effective Membership Inference Attack Exploiting "All for One" Principle in Federated Learning | Gongxi Zhu, Donghao Li, Hanlin Gu, Yuan Yao, Lixin Fan, Yuxing Han | Federated Learning (FL) is a promising approach for training machine learning models on decentralized data while preserving privacy. However, privacy risks, particularly Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), which aim to determine whether a specific data point belongs to a target client's training set, remain a significant concern. Existing methods for implementing MIAs in FL primarily analyze updates from the target client, focusing on metrics such as loss, gradient norm, and gradient difference. However, these methods fail to leverage updates from non-target clients, potentially underutilizing available information. In this paper, we first formulate a one-tailed likelihood-ratio hypothesis test based on the likelihood of updates from non-target clients. Building upon this formulation, we introduce a three-step Membership Inference Attack (MIA) method, called FedMIA, which follows the "all for one"--leveraging updates from all clients across multiple communication rounds to enhance MIA effectiveness. Both theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results demonstrate that FedMIA outperforms existing MIAs in both classification and generative tasks. Additionally, it can be integrated as an extension to existing methods and is robust against various defense strategies, Non-IID data, and different federated structures.

| WonderWorld: Interactive 3D Scene Generation from a Single Image | Hong-Xing Yu, Haoyi Duan, Charles Herrmann, William T. Freeman, Jiajun Wu | We present WonderWorld, a novel framework for interactive 3D scene generation that enables users to interactively specify scene contents and layout and see the created scenes in low latency. The major challenge lies in achieving fast generation of 3D scenes. Existing scene generation approaches fall short of speed as they often require (1) progressively generating many views and depth maps, and (2) time-consuming optimization of the scene geometry representations. We introduce the Fast Layered Gaussian Surfels (FLAGS) as our scene representation and an algorithm to generate it from a single view. Our approach does not need multiple views, and it leverages a geometry-based initialization that significantly reduces optimization time. Another challenge is generating coherent geometry that allows all scenes to be connected. We introduce the guided depth diffusion that allows partial conditioning of depth estimation. WonderWorld generates connected and diverse 3D scenes in less than 10 seconds on a single A6000 GPU, enabling real-time user interaction and exploration.

| Domain Adaptive Diabetic Retinopathy Grading with Model Absence and Flowing Data | Wenxin Su, Song Tang, Xiaofeng Liu, Xiaojing Yi, Mao Ye, Chunxiao Zu, Jiahao Li, Xiatian Zhu | Domain shift (the difference between source and target domains) poses a significant challenge in clinical applications, e.g., Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) grading. Despite considering certain clinical requirements, like source data privacy, conventional transfer methods are predominantly model-centered and often struggle to prevent model-targeted attacks. In this paper, we address a challenging Online Model-aGnostic Domain Adaptation (OMG-DA) setting, driven by the demands of clinical environments. This setting is characterized by the absence of the model and the flow of target data. To tackle the new challenge, we propose a novel approach, Generative Unadversarial ExampleS (GUES), which enables adaptation from a data-centric perspective. Specifically, we first theoretically reformulate conventional perturbation optimization in a generative way--learning a perturbation generation function with a latent input variable. During model instantiation, we leverage a Variational AutoEncoder to express this function. The encoder with the reparameterization trick predicts the latent input, whilst the decoder is responsible for the generation. Furthermore, the saliency map is selected as pseudo-perturbation labels. Because it not only captures potential lesions but also theoretically provides an upper bound on the function input, enabling the identification of the latent variable. Extensive comparative experiments on DR benchmarks with both frozen pre-trained models and trainable models demonstrate the superiority of GUES, showing robustness even with small batch size. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01203v1) | N/A |
| Motion Prompting: Controlling Video Generation with Motion Trajectories | Daniel Geng, Charles Herrmann, Junhwa Hur, Forrester Cole, Serena Zhang, Tobias Pfaff, Tatiana Lopez-Guevara, Carl Doersch, Yusuf Aytar, Michael Rubinstein, Chen Sun, Oliver Wang, Andrew Owens, Deqing Sun | Motion control is crucial for generating expressive and compelling video content; however, most existing video generation models rely mainly on text prompts for control, which struggle to capture the nuances of dynamic actions and temporal compositions. To this end, we train a video generation model conditioned on spatio-temporally sparse or dense motion trajectories. In contrast to prior motion conditioning work, this flexible representation can encode any number of trajectories, object-specific or global scene motion, and temporally sparse motion; due to its flexibility we refer to this conditioning as motion prompts. While users may directly specify sparse trajectories, we also show how to translate high-level user requests into detailed, semi-dense motion prompts, a process we term motion prompt expansion. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach through various applications, including camera and object motion control, "interacting" with an image, motion transfer, and image editing. Our results showcase emergent behaviors, such as realistic physics, suggesting the potential of motion prompts for probing video models and interacting with future generative world models. Finally, we evaluate quantitatively, conduct a human study, and demonstrate strong performance.

| LeviTor: 3D Trajectory Oriented Image-to-Video Synthesis | Hanlin Wang, Hao Ouyang, Qiuyu Wang, Wen Wang, Ka Leong Cheng, Qifeng Chen, Yujun Shen, Limin Wang | The intuitive nature of drag-based interaction has led to its growing adoption for controlling object trajectories in image-to-video synthesis. Still, existing methods that perform dragging in the 2D space usually face ambiguity when handling out-of-plane movements. In this work, we augment the interaction with a new dimension, i.e., the depth dimension, such that users are allowed to assign a relative depth for each point on the trajectory. That way, our new interaction paradigm not only inherits the convenience from 2D dragging, but facilitates trajectory control in the 3D space, broadening the scope of creativity. We propose a pioneering method for 3D trajectory control in image-to-video synthesis by abstracting object masks into a few cluster points. These points, accompanied by the depth information and the instance information, are finally fed into a video diffusion model as the control signal. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, dubbed LeviTor, in precisely manipulating the object movements when producing photo-realistic videos from static images.

| CAT4D: Create Anything in 4D with Multi-View Video Diffusion Models | Rundi Wu, Ruiqi Gao, Ben Poole, Alex Trevithick, Changxi Zheng, Jonathan T. Barron, Aleksander Holynski | We present CAT4D, a method for creating 4D (dynamic 3D) scenes from monocular video. CAT4D leverages a multi-view video diffusion model trained on a diverse combination of datasets to enable novel view synthesis at any specified camera poses and timestamps. Combined with a novel sampling approach, this model can transform a single monocular video into a multi-view video, enabling robust 4D reconstruction via optimization of a deformable 3D Gaussian representation.

| An End-to-End Robust Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation Network with Single-Step Conditional Diffusion Models | Wentao Qu, Jing Wang, YongShun Gong, Xiaoshui Huang, Liang Xiao | Existing conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) with a Noise-Conditional Framework (NCF) remain challenging for 3D scene understanding tasks, as the complex geometric details in scenes increase the difficulty of fitting the gradients of the data distribution (the scores) from semantic labels. This also results in longer training and inference time for DDPMs compared to non-DDPMs. From a different perspective, we delve deeply into the model paradigm dominated by the Conditional Network. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end robust semantic Segmentation Network based on a Conditional-Noise Framework (CNF) of DDPMs, named CDSegNet. Specifically, CDSegNet models the Noise Network (NN) as a learnable noise-feature generator. This enables the Conditional Network (CN) to understand 3D scene semantics under multi-level feature perturbations, enhancing the generalization in unseen scenes. Meanwhile, benefiting from the noise system of DDPMs, CDSegNet exhibits strong noise and sparsity robustness in experiments. Moreover, thanks to CNF, CDSegNet can generate the semantic labels in a single-step inference like non-DDPMs, due to avoiding directly fitting the scores from semantic labels in the dominant network of CDSegNet. On public indoor and outdoor benchmarks, CDSegNet significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16308v3) | [https://github.com/QWTforGithub/CDSegNet](https://github.com/QWTforGithub/CDSegNet) |
| PERSE: Personalized 3D Generative Avatars from A Single Portrait | Hyunsoo Cha, Inhee Lee, Hanbyul Joo | We present PERSE, a method for building an animatable personalized generative avatar from a reference portrait. Our avatar model enables facial attribute editing in a continuous and disentangled latent space to control each facial attribute, while preserving the individual's identity. To achieve this, our method begins by synthesizing large-scale synthetic 2D video datasets, where each video contains consistent changes in the facial expression and viewpoint, combined with a variation in a specific facial attribute from the original input. We propose a novel pipeline to produce high-quality, photorealistic 2D videos with facial attribute editing. Leveraging this synthetic attribute dataset, we present a personalized avatar creation method based on the 3D Gaussian Splatting, learning a continuous and disentangled latent space for intuitive facial attribute manipulation. To enforce smooth transitions in this latent space, we introduce a latent space regularization technique by using interpolated 2D faces as supervision. Compared to previous approaches, we demonstrate that PERSE generates high-quality avatars with interpolated attributes while preserving identity of reference person. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.21206v1) | [https://hyunsoocha.github.io/perse](https://hyunsoocha.github.io/perse) |
| HeatFormer: A Neural Optimizer for Multiview Human Mesh Recovery | Yuto Matsubara, Ko Nishino | We introduce a novel method for human shape and pose recovery that can fully leverage multiple static views. We target fixed-multiview people monitoring, including elderly care and safety monitoring, in which calibrated cameras can be installed at the corners of a room or an open space but whose configuration may vary depending on the environment. Our key idea is to formulate it as neural optimization. We achieve this with HeatFormer, a neural optimizer that iteratively refines the SMPL parameters given multiview images, which is fundamentally agonistic to the configuration of views. HeatFormer realizes this SMPL parameter estimation as heat map generation and alignment with a novel transformer encoder and decoder. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HeatFormer including its accuracy, robustness to occlusion, and generalizability through an extensive set of experiments. We believe HeatFormer can serve a key role in passive human behavior modeling. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04456v2) | N/A |
| Accurate Differential Operators for Hybrid Neural Fields | Aditya Chetan, Guandao Yang, Zichen Wang, Steve Marschner, Bharath Hariharan | Neural fields have become widely used in various fields, from shape representation to neural rendering, and for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). With the advent of hybrid neural field representations like Instant NGP that leverage small MLPs and explicit representations, these models train quickly and can fit large scenes. Yet in many applications like rendering and simulation, hybrid neural fields can cause noticeable and unreasonable artifacts. This is because they do not yield accurate spatial derivatives needed for these downstream applications. In this work, we propose two ways to circumvent these challenges. Our first approach is a post hoc operator that uses local polynomial-fitting to obtain more accurate derivatives from pre-trained hybrid neural fields. Additionally, we also propose a self-supervised fine-tuning approach that refines the neural field to yield accurate derivatives directly while preserving the initial signal. We show the application of our method on rendering, collision simulation, and solving PDEs. We observe that using our approach yields more accurate derivatives, reducing artifacts and leading to more accurate simulations in downstream applications. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.05984v1) | [https://github.com/NVlabs/tiny-cuda-nn](https://github.com/NVlabs/tiny-cuda-nn), [https://github.com/odedstein/meshes](https://github.com/odedstein/meshes), [https://justachetan.github.io/hnf-derivatives](https://justachetan.github.io/hnf-derivatives) |
| StableAnimator: High-Quality Identity-Preserving Human Image Animation | Shuyuan Tu, Zhen Xing, Xintong Han, Zhi-Qi Cheng, Qi Dai, Chong Luo, Zuxuan Wu | Current diffusion models for human image animation struggle to ensure identity (ID) consistency. This paper presents StableAnimator, the first end-to-end ID-preserving video diffusion framework, which synthesizes high-quality videos without any post-processing, conditioned on a reference image and a sequence of poses. Building upon a video diffusion model, StableAnimator contains carefully designed modules for both training and inference striving for identity consistency. In particular, StableAnimator begins by computing image and face embeddings with off-the-shelf extractors, respectively and face embeddings are further refined by interacting with image embeddings using a global content-aware Face Encoder. Then, StableAnimator introduces a novel distribution-aware ID Adapter that prevents interference caused by temporal layers while preserving ID via alignment. During inference, we propose a novel Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation-based optimization to further enhance the face quality. We demonstrate that solving the HJB equation can be integrated into the diffusion denoising process, and the resulting solution constrains the denoising path and thus benefits ID preservation. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show the effectiveness of StableAnimator both qualitatively and quantitatively. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.17697v2) | [https://francis-rings.github.io/StableAnimator](https://francis-rings.github.io/StableAnimator) |
| Words or Vision: Do Vision-Language Models Have Blind Faith in Text? | Ailin Deng, Tri Cao, Zhirui Chen, Bryan Hooi | Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in integrating visual and textual information for vision-centric tasks, but their handling of inconsistencies between modalities is underexplored. We investigate VLMs' modality preferences when faced with visual data and varied textual inputs in vision-centered settings. By introducing textual variations to four vision-centric tasks and evaluating ten Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we discover a \emph{``blind faith in text''} phenomenon: VLMs disproportionately trust textual data over visual data when inconsistencies arise, leading to significant performance drops under corrupted text and raising safety concerns. We analyze factors influencing this text bias, including instruction prompts, language model size, text relevance, token order, and the interplay between visual and textual certainty. While certain factors, such as scaling up the language model size, slightly mitigate text bias, others like token order can exacerbate it due to positional biases inherited from language models. To address this issue, we explore supervised fine-tuning with text augmentation and demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing text bias. Additionally, we provide a theoretical analysis suggesting that the blind faith in text phenomenon may stem from an imbalance of pure text and multi-modal data during training. Our findings highlight the need for balanced training and careful consideration of modality interactions in VLMs to enhance their robustness and reliability in handling multi-modal data inconsistencies. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.02199v1) | [https://github.com/d-ailin/blind-faith-in-text](https://github.com/d-ailin/blind-faith-in-text) |
| Stereo4D: Learning How Things Move in 3D from Internet Stereo Videos | Linyi Jin, Richard Tucker, Zhengqi Li, David Fouhey, Noah Snavely, Aleksander Holynski | Learning to understand dynamic 3D scenes from imagery is crucial for applications ranging from robotics to scene reconstruction. Yet, unlike other problems where large-scale supervised training has enabled rapid progress, directly supervising methods for recovering 3D motion remains challenging due to the fundamental difficulty of obtaining ground truth annotations. We present a system for mining high-quality 4D reconstructions from internet stereoscopic, wide-angle videos. Our system fuses and filters the outputs of camera pose estimation, stereo depth estimation, and temporal tracking methods into high-quality dynamic 3D reconstructions. We use this method to generate large-scale data in the form of world-consistent, pseudo-metric 3D point clouds with long-term motion trajectories. We demonstrate the utility of this data by training a variant of DUSt3R to predict structure and 3D motion from real-world image pairs, showing that training on our reconstructed data enables generalization to diverse real-world scenes.

| NVComposer: Boosting Generative Novel View Synthesis with Multiple Sparse and Unposed Images | Lingen Li, Zhaoyang Zhang, Yaowei Li, Jiale Xu, Wenbo Hu, Xiaoyu Li, Weihao Cheng, Jinwei Gu, Tianfan Xue, Ying Shan | Recent advancements in generative models have significantly improved novel view synthesis (NVS) from multi-view data. However, existing methods depend on external multi-view alignment processes, such as explicit pose estimation or pre-reconstruction, which limits their flexibility and accessibility, especially when alignment is unstable due to insufficient overlap or occlusions between views. In this paper, we propose NVComposer, a novel approach that eliminates the need for explicit external alignment. NVComposer enables the generative model to implicitly infer spatial and geometric relationships between multiple conditional views by introducing two key components: 1) an image-pose dual-stream diffusion model that simultaneously generates target novel views and condition camera poses, and 2) a geometry-aware feature alignment module that distills geometric priors from dense stereo models during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NVComposer achieves state-of-the-art performance in generative multi-view NVS tasks, removing the reliance on external alignment and thus improving model accessibility. Our approach shows substantial improvements in synthesis quality as the number of unposed input views increases, highlighting its potential for more flexible and accessible generative NVS systems.

| Distilling Spectral Graph for Object-Context Aware Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation | Chanyoung Kim, Dayun Ju, Woojung Han, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Seong Jae Hwang | Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) has advanced with recent vision-language models (VLMs), enabling segmentation beyond predefined categories through various learning schemes. Notably, training-free methods offer scalable, easily deployable solutions for handling unseen data, a key goal of OVSS. Yet, a critical issue persists: lack of object-level context consideration when segmenting complex objects in the challenging environment of OVSS based on arbitrary query prompts. This oversight limits models' ability to group semantically consistent elements within object and map them precisely to user-defined arbitrary classes. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that overcomes this limitation by incorporating object-level contextual knowledge within images. Specifically, our model enhances intra-object consistency by distilling spectral-driven features from vision foundation models into the attention mechanism of the visual encoder, enabling semantically coherent components to form a single object mask. Additionally, we refine the text embeddings with zero-shot object presence likelihood to ensure accurate alignment with the specific objects represented in the images. By leveraging object-level contextual knowledge, our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong generalizability across diverse datasets. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.17150v1) | [https://micv-yonsei.github.io/cass](https://micv-yonsei.github.io/cass) |
| Rethinking Epistemic and Aleatoric Uncertainty for Active Open-Set Annotation: An Energy-Based Approach | Chen-Chen Zong, Sheng-Jun Huang | Active learning (AL), which iteratively queries the most informative examples from a large pool of unlabeled candidates for model training, faces significant challenges in the presence of open-set classes. Existing methods either prioritize query examples likely to belong to known classes, indicating low epistemic uncertainty (EU), or focus on querying those with highly uncertain predictions, reflecting high aleatoric uncertainty (AU). However, they both yield suboptimal performance, as low EU corresponds to limited useful information, and closed-set AU metrics for unknown class examples are less meaningful. In this paper, we propose an Energy-based Active Open-set Annotation (EAOA) framework, which effectively integrates EU and AU to achieve superior performance. EAOA features a $(C+1)$-class detector and a target classifier, incorporating an energy-based EU measure and a margin-based energy loss designed for the detector, alongside an energy-based AU measure for the target classifier. Another crucial component is the target-driven adaptive sampling strategy. It first forms a smaller candidate set with low EU scores to ensure closed-set properties, making AU metrics meaningful. Subsequently, examples with high AU scores are queried to form the final query set, with the candidate set size adjusted adaptively. Extensive experiments show that EAOA achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high query precision and low training overhead.

| EasyHOI: Unleashing the Power of Large Models for Reconstructing Hand-Object Interactions in the Wild | Yumeng Liu, Xiaoxiao Long, Zemin Yang, Yuan Liu, Marc Habermann, Christian Theobalt, Yuexin Ma, Wenping Wang | Our work aims to reconstruct hand-object interactions from a single-view image, which is a fundamental but ill-posed task. Unlike methods that reconstruct from videos, multi-view images, or predefined 3D templates, single-view reconstruction faces significant challenges due to inherent ambiguities and occlusions. These challenges are further amplified by the diverse nature of hand poses and the vast variety of object shapes and sizes. Our key insight is that current foundational models for segmentation, inpainting, and 3D reconstruction robustly generalize to in-the-wild images, which could provide strong visual and geometric priors for reconstructing hand-object interactions. Specifically, given a single image, we first design a novel pipeline to estimate the underlying hand pose and object shape using off-the-shelf large models. Furthermore, with the initial reconstruction, we employ a prior-guided optimization scheme, which optimizes hand pose to comply with 3D physical constraints and the 2D input image content. We perform experiments across several datasets and show that our method consistently outperforms baselines and faithfully reconstructs a diverse set of hand-object interactions.

| Light Transport-aware Diffusion Posterior Sampling for Single-View Reconstruction of 3D Volumes | Ludwic Leonard, Nils Thuerey, Ruediger Westermann | We introduce a single-view reconstruction technique of volumetric fields in which multiple light scattering effects are omnipresent, such as in clouds. We model the unknown distribution of volumetric fields using an unconditional diffusion model trained on a novel benchmark dataset comprising 1,000 synthetically simulated volumetric density fields. The neural diffusion model is trained on the latent codes of a novel, diffusion-friendly, monoplanar representation. The generative model is used to incorporate a tailored parametric diffusion posterior sampling technique into different reconstruction tasks. A physically-based differentiable volume renderer is employed to provide gradients with respect to light transport in the latent space. This stands in contrast to classic NeRF approaches and makes the reconstructions better aligned with observed data. Through various experiments, we demonstrate single-view reconstruction of volumetric clouds at a previously unattainable quality. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05226v2) | N/A |
| Ouroboros3D: Image-to-3D Generation via 3D-aware Recursive Diffusion | Hao Wen, Zehuan Huang, Yaohui Wang, Xinyuan Chen, Yu Qiao, Lu Sheng | Existing single image-to-3D creation methods typically involve a two-stage process, first generating multi-view images, and then using these images for 3D reconstruction. However, training these two stages separately leads to significant data bias in the inference phase, thus affecting the quality of reconstructed results. We introduce a unified 3D generation framework, named Ouroboros3D, which integrates diffusion-based multi-view image generation and 3D reconstruction into a recursive diffusion process. In our framework, these two modules are jointly trained through a self-conditioning mechanism, allowing them to adapt to each other's characteristics for robust inference. During the multi-view denoising process, the multi-view diffusion model uses the 3D-aware maps rendered by the reconstruction module at the previous timestep as additional conditions. The recursive diffusion framework with 3D-aware feedback unites the entire process and improves geometric consistency.Experiments show that our framework outperforms separation of these two stages and existing methods that combine them at the inference phase.

| ManiVideo: Generating Hand-Object Manipulation Video with Dexterous and Generalizable Grasping | Youxin Pang, Ruizhi Shao, Jiajun Zhang, Hanzhang Tu, Yun Liu, Boyao Zhou, Hongwen Zhang, Yebin Liu | In this paper, we introduce ManiVideo, a novel method for generating consistent and temporally coherent bimanual hand-object manipulation videos from given motion sequences of hands and objects. The core idea of ManiVideo is the construction of a multi-layer occlusion (MLO) representation that learns 3D occlusion relationships from occlusion-free normal maps and occlusion confidence maps. By embedding the MLO structure into the UNet in two forms, the model enhances the 3D consistency of dexterous hand-object manipulation. To further achieve the generalizable grasping of objects, we integrate Objaverse, a large-scale 3D object dataset, to address the scarcity of video data, thereby facilitating the learning of extensive object consistency. Additionally, we propose an innovative training strategy that effectively integrates multiple datasets, supporting downstream tasks such as human-centric hand-object manipulation video generation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach not only achieves video generation with plausible hand-object interaction and generalizable objects, but also outperforms existing SOTA methods. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16212v1) | N/A |
| Extrapolating and Decoupling Image-to-Video Generation Models: Motion Modeling is Easier Than You Think | Jie Tian, Xiaoye Qu, Zhenyi Lu, Wei Wei, Sichen Liu, Yu Cheng | Image-to-Video (I2V) generation aims to synthesize a video clip according to a given image and condition (e.g., text). The key challenge of this task lies in simultaneously generating natural motions while preserving the original appearance of the images. However, current I2V diffusion models (I2V-DMs) often produce videos with limited motion degrees or exhibit uncontrollable motion that conflicts with the textual condition. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Extrapolating and Decoupling framework, which introduces model merging techniques to the I2V domain for the first time. Specifically, our framework consists of three separate stages: (1) Starting with a base I2V-DM, we explicitly inject the textual condition into the temporal module using a lightweight, learnable adapter and fine-tune the integrated model to improve motion controllability. (2) We introduce a training-free extrapolation strategy to amplify the dynamic range of the motion, effectively reversing the fine-tuning process to enhance the motion degree significantly. (3) With the above two-stage models excelling in motion controllability and degree, we decouple the relevant parameters associated with each type of motion ability and inject them into the base I2V-DM. Since the I2V-DM handles different levels of motion controllability and dynamics at various denoising time steps, we adjust the motion-aware parameters accordingly over time. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the superiority of our framework over existing methods. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00948v1) | [https://github.com/Chuge0335/EDG](https://github.com/Chuge0335/EDG) |
| Infinity: Scaling Bitwise AutoRegressive Modeling for High-Resolution Image Synthesis | Jian Han, Jinlai Liu, Yi Jiang, Bin Yan, Yuqi Zhang, Zehuan Yuan, Bingyue Peng, Xiaobing Liu | We present Infinity, a Bitwise Visual AutoRegressive Modeling capable of generating high-resolution, photorealistic images following language instruction. Infinity redefines visual autoregressive model under a bitwise token prediction framework with an infinite-vocabulary tokenizer & classifier and bitwise self-correction mechanism, remarkably improving the generation capacity and details. By theoretically scaling the tokenizer vocabulary size to infinity and concurrently scaling the transformer size, our method significantly unleashes powerful scaling capabilities compared to vanilla VAR. Infinity sets a new record for autoregressive text-to-image models, outperforming top-tier diffusion models like SD3-Medium and SDXL. Notably, Infinity surpasses SD3-Medium by improving the GenEval benchmark score from 0.62 to 0.73 and the ImageReward benchmark score from 0.87 to 0.96, achieving a win rate of 66%. Without extra optimization, Infinity generates a high-quality 1024x1024 image in 0.8 seconds, making it 2.6x faster than SD3-Medium and establishing it as the fastest text-to-image model.

| CamFreeDiff: Camera-free Image to Panorama Generation with Diffusion Model | Xiaoding Yuan, Shitao Tang, Kejie Li, Alan Yuille, Peng Wang | This paper introduces Camera-free Diffusion (CamFreeDiff) model for 360-degree image outpainting from a single camera-free image and text description. This method distinguishes itself from existing strategies, such as MVDiffusion, by eliminating the requirement for predefined camera poses. Instead, our model incorporates a mechanism for predicting homography directly within the multi-view diffusion framework. The core of our approach is to formulate camera estimation by predicting the homography transformation from the input view to a predefined canonical view. The homography provides point-level correspondences between the input image and targeting panoramic images, allowing connections enforced by correspondence-aware attention in a fully differentiable manner. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate our model's strong robustness and generalization ability for 360-degree image outpainting in the challenging context of camera-free inputs. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07174v1) | N/A |

Existing generic VLMs do not perform well on Remote Sensing data, while the recent Geo-spatial VLMs remain restricted to a fixed resolution and few sensor modalities. In this paper, we introduce EarthDial, a conversational assistant specifically designed for Earth Observation (EO) data, transforming complex, multi-sensory Earth observations into interactive, natural language dialogues. EarthDial supports multi-spectral, multi-temporal, and multi-resolution imagery, enabling a wide range of remote sensing tasks, including classification, detection, captioning, question answering, visual reasoning, and visual grounding. To achieve this, we introduce an extensive instruction tuning dataset comprising over 11.11M instruction pairs covering RGB, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), and multispectral modalities such as Near-Infrared (NIR) and infrared. Furthermore, EarthDial handles bi-temporal and multi-temporal sequence analysis for applications like change detection. Our extensive experimental results on 37 downstream applications demonstrate that EarthDial outperforms existing generic and domain-specific models, achieving better generalization across various EO tasks. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15190v1) | N/A |
| InsightEdit: Towards Better Instruction Following for Image Editing | Yingjing Xu, Jie Kong, Jiazhi Wang, Xiao Pan, Bo Lin, Qiang Liu | In this paper, we focus on the task of instruction-based image editing. Previous works like InstructPix2Pix, InstructDiffusion, and SmartEdit have explored end-to-end editing. However, two limitations still remain: First, existing datasets suffer from low resolution, poor background consistency, and overly simplistic instructions. Second, current approaches mainly condition on the text while the rich image information is underexplored, therefore inferior in complex instruction following and maintaining background consistency. Targeting these issues, we first curated the AdvancedEdit dataset using a novel data construction pipeline, formulating a large-scale dataset with high visual quality, complex instructions, and good background consistency. Then, to further inject the rich image information, we introduce a two-stream bridging mechanism utilizing both the textual and visual features reasoned by the powerful Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) to guide the image editing process more precisely. Extensive results demonstrate that our approach, InsightEdit, achieves state-of-the-art performance, excelling in complex instruction following and maintaining high background consistency with the original image. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.17323v1) | [https://poppyxu.github.io/InsightEdit](https://poppyxu.github.io/InsightEdit) |

Specifically, by employing a simple PointGoal Navigation model combined with a memory-based exploration policy as a foundational primitive for guiding an agent through the world, we show how a single model can address diverse tasks without additional training. We task an LLM with composing the provided primitives to solve a specific task, using only a few in-context examples in the prompt. We evaluate our approach on three key Embodied AI tasks: Open-Set ObjectGoal Navigation, Multi-Modal Lifelong Navigation, and Open Embodied Question Answering, achieving state-of-the-art results without any specific fine-tuning in challenging zero-shot scenarios. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10402v1) | N/A |

Yet, such temporal comprehension capabilities are neither well-studied nor understood. So we conduct a study on prediction consistency -- a key indicator for robustness and trustworthiness of temporal grounding. After the model identifies an initial moment within the video content, we apply a series of probes to check if the model's responses align with this initial grounding as an indicator of reliable comprehension. Our results reveal that current Video-LLMs are sensitive to variations in video contents, language queries, and task settings, unveiling severe deficiencies in maintaining consistency. We further explore common prompting and instruction-tuning methods as potential solutions, but find that their improvements are often unstable. To that end, we propose event temporal verification tuning that explicitly accounts for consistency, and demonstrate significant improvements for both grounding and consistency. Our data and code will be available at https://github.com/minjoong507/Consistency-of-Video-LLM. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.12951v1) | N/A |
| Can Generative Video Models Help Pose Estimation? | Ruojin Cai, Jason Y. Zhang, Philipp Henzler, Zhengqi Li, Noah Snavely, Ricardo Martin-Brualla | Pairwise pose estimation from images with little or no overlap is an open challenge in computer vision. Existing methods, even those trained on large-scale datasets, struggle in these scenarios due to the lack of identifiable correspondences or visual overlap. Inspired by the human ability to infer spatial relationships from diverse scenes, we propose a novel approach, InterPose, that leverages the rich priors encoded within pre-trained generative video models. We propose to use a video model to hallucinate intermediate frames between two input images, effectively creating a dense, visual transition, which significantly simplifies the problem of pose estimation. Since current video models can still produce implausible motion or inconsistent geometry, we introduce a self-consistency score that evaluates the consistency of pose predictions from sampled videos. We demonstrate that our approach generalizes among three state-of-the-art video models and show consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art DUSt3R on four diverse datasets encompassing indoor, outdoor, and object-centric scenes. Our findings suggest a promising avenue for improving pose estimation models by leveraging large generative models trained on vast amounts of video data, which is more readily available than 3D data.

| Tiled Diffusion | Or Madar, Ohad Fried | Image tiling -- the seamless connection of disparate images to create a coherent visual field -- is crucial for applications such as texture creation, video game asset development, and digital art. Traditionally, tiles have been constructed manually, a method that poses significant limitations in scalability and flexibility. Recent research has attempted to automate this process using generative models. However, current approaches primarily focus on tiling textures and manipulating models for single-image generation, without inherently supporting the creation of multiple interconnected tiles across diverse domains. This paper presents Tiled Diffusion, a novel approach that extends the capabilities of diffusion models to accommodate the generation of cohesive tiling patterns across various domains of image synthesis that require tiling. Our method supports a wide range of tiling scenarios, from self-tiling to complex many-to-many connections, enabling seamless integration of multiple images. Tiled Diffusion automates the tiling process, eliminating the need for manual intervention and enhancing creative possibilities in various applications, such as seamlessly tiling of existing images, tiled texture creation, and 360{\deg} synthesis. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15185v1) | N/A |
| Pippo: High-Resolution Multi-View Humans from a Single Image | Yash Kant, Ethan Weber, Jin Kyu Kim, Rawal Khirodkar, Su Zhaoen, Julieta Martinez, Igor Gilitschenski, Shunsuke Saito, Timur Bagautdinov | We present Pippo, a generative model capable of producing 1K resolution dense turnaround videos of a person from a single casually clicked photo. Pippo is a multi-view diffusion transformer and does not require any additional inputs - e.g., a fitted parametric model or camera parameters of the input image. We pre-train Pippo on 3B human images without captions, and conduct multi-view mid-training and post-training on studio captured humans. During mid-training, to quickly absorb the studio dataset, we denoise several (up to 48) views at low-resolution, and encode target cameras coarsely using a shallow MLP. During post-training, we denoise fewer views at high-resolution and use pixel-aligned controls (e.g., Spatial anchor and Plucker rays) to enable 3D consistent generations. At inference, we propose an attention biasing technique that allows Pippo to simultaneously generate greater than 5 times as many views as seen during training. Finally, we also introduce an improved metric to evaluate 3D consistency of multi-view generations, and show that Pippo outperforms existing works on multi-view human generation from a single image. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07785v1) | [https://github.com/black-forest-labs/flux](https://github.com/black-forest-labs/flux), [http://yashkant.github.io/pippo](http://yashkant.github.io/pippo), [http://yashkant.github.io/pippo](http://yashkant.github.io/pippo) |
| Pose Priors from Language Models | Sanjay Subramanian, Evonne Ng, Lea Müller, Dan Klein, Shiry Ginosar, Trevor Darrell | We present a zero-shot pose optimization method that enforces accurate physical contact constraints when estimating the 3D pose of humans. Our central insight is that since language is often used to describe physical interaction, large pretrained text-based models can act as priors on pose estimation.   We can thus leverage this insight to improve pose estimation by converting natural language descriptors, generated by a large multimodal model (LMM), into tractable losses to constrain the 3D pose optimization. Despite its simplicity, our method produces surprisingly compelling pose reconstructions of people in close contact, correctly capturing the semantics of the social and physical interactions. We demonstrate that our method rivals more complex state-of-the-art approaches that require expensive human annotation of contact points and training specialized models. Moreover, unlike previous approaches, our method provides a unified framework for resolving self-contact and person-to-person contact. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.03689v1) | [https://huggingface.co/spaces/WildVision](https://huggingface.co/spaces/WildVision) |
| Imagine and Seek: Improving Composed Image Retrieval with an Imagined Proxy | You Li, Fan Ma, Yi Yang | The Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZSCIR) requires retrieving images that match the query image and the relative captions. Current methods focus on projecting the query image into the text feature space, subsequently combining them with features of query texts for retrieval. However, retrieving images only with the text features cannot guarantee detailed alignment due to the natural gap between images and text. In this paper, we introduce Imagined Proxy for CIR (IP-CIR), a training-free method that creates a proxy image aligned with the query image and text description, enhancing query representation in the retrieval process. We first leverage the large language model's generalization capability to generate an image layout, and then apply both the query text and image for conditional generation. The robust query features are enhanced by merging the proxy image, query image, and text semantic perturbation. Our newly proposed balancing metric integrates text-based and proxy retrieval similarities, allowing for more accurate retrieval of the target image while incorporating image-side information into the process. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves retrieval performances. We achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on the CIRR dataset with a Recall@K of 70.07 at K=10. Additionally, we achieved an improvement in Recall@10 on the FashionIQ dataset, rising from 45.11 to 45.74, and improved the baseline performance in CIRCO with a mAPK@10 score, increasing from 32.24 to 34.26. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16752v2) | N/A |
| OccMamba: Semantic Occupancy Prediction with State Space Models | Heng Li, Yuenan Hou, Xiaohan Xing, Xiao Sun, Yanyong Zhang | Training deep learning models for semantic occupancy prediction is challenging due to factors such as a large number of occupancy cells, severe occlusion, limited visual cues, complicated driving scenarios, etc. Recent methods often adopt transformer-based architectures given their strong capability in learning input-conditioned weights and long-range relationships. However, transformer-based networks are notorious for their quadratic computation complexity, seriously undermining their efficacy and deployment in semantic occupancy prediction. Inspired by the global modeling and linear computation complexity of the Mamba architecture, we present the first Mamba-based network for semantic occupancy prediction, termed OccMamba. However, directly applying the Mamba architecture to the occupancy prediction task yields unsatisfactory performance due to the inherent domain gap between the linguistic and 3D domains. To relieve this problem, we present a simple yet effective 3D-to-1D reordering operation, i.e., height-prioritized 2D Hilbert expansion. It can maximally retain the spatial structure of point clouds as well as facilitate the processing of Mamba blocks. Our OccMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance on three prevalent occupancy prediction benchmarks, including OpenOccupancy, SemanticKITTI and SemanticPOSS. Notably, on OpenOccupancy, our OccMamba outperforms the previous state-of-the-art Co-Occ by 3.1% IoU and 3.2% mIoU, respectively. Codes will be released upon publication. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09859v1) | N/A |
| Detecting Adversarial Data using Perturbation Forgery | Qian Wang, Chen Li, Yuchen Luo, Hefei Ling, Shijuan Huang, Ruoxi Jia, Ning Yu | As a defense strategy against adversarial attacks, adversarial detection aims to identify and filter out adversarial data from the data flow based on discrepancies in distribution and noise patterns between natural and adversarial data. Although previous detection methods achieve high performance in detecting gradient-based adversarial attacks, new attacks based on generative models with imbalanced and anisotropic noise patterns evade detection. Even worse, the significant inference time overhead and limited performance against unseen attacks make existing techniques impractical for real-world use. In this paper, we explore the proximity relationship among adversarial noise distributions and demonstrate the existence of an open covering for these distributions. By training on the open covering of adversarial noise distributions, a detector with strong generalization performance against various types of unseen attacks can be developed. Based on this insight, we heuristically propose Perturbation Forgery, which includes noise distribution perturbation, sparse mask generation, and pseudo-adversarial data production, to train an adversarial detector capable of detecting any unseen gradient-based, generative-based, and physical adversarial attacks. Comprehensive experiments conducted on multiple general and facial datasets, with a wide spectrum of attacks, validate the strong generalization of our method. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.16226v4) | [https://github.com/cc13qq/PFD](https://github.com/cc13qq/PFD) |
| SimVS: Simulating World Inconsistencies for Robust View Synthesis | Alex Trevithick, Roni Paiss, Philipp Henzler, Dor Verbin, Rundi Wu, Hadi Alzayer, Ruiqi Gao, Ben Poole, Jonathan T. Barron, Aleksander Holynski, Ravi Ramamoorthi, Pratul P. Srinivasan | Novel-view synthesis techniques achieve impressive results for static scenes but struggle when faced with the inconsistencies inherent to casual capture settings: varying illumination, scene motion, and other unintended effects that are difficult to model explicitly. We present an approach for leveraging generative video models to simulate the inconsistencies in the world that can occur during capture. We use this process, along with existing multi-view datasets, to create synthetic data for training a multi-view harmonization network that is able to reconcile inconsistent observations into a consistent 3D scene. We demonstrate that our world-simulation strategy significantly outperforms traditional augmentation methods in handling real-world scene variations, thereby enabling highly accurate static 3D reconstructions in the presence of a variety of challenging inconsistencies.

| Continuous 3D Perception Model with Persistent State | Qianqian Wang, Yifei Zhang, Aleksander Holynski, Alexei A. Efros, Angjoo Kanazawa | We present a unified framework capable of solving a broad range of 3D tasks. Our approach features a stateful recurrent model that continuously updates its state representation with each new observation. Given a stream of images, this evolving state can be used to generate metric-scale pointmaps (per-pixel 3D points) for each new input in an online fashion. These pointmaps reside within a common coordinate system, and can be accumulated into a coherent, dense scene reconstruction that updates as new images arrive. Our model, called CUT3R (Continuous Updating Transformer for 3D Reconstruction), captures rich priors of real-world scenes: not only can it predict accurate pointmaps from image observations, but it can also infer unseen regions of the scene by probing at virtual, unobserved views. Our method is simple yet highly flexible, naturally accepting varying lengths of images that may be either video streams or unordered photo collections, containing both static and dynamic content. We evaluate our method on various 3D/4D tasks and demonstrate competitive or state-of-the-art performance in each.

| ForestLPR: LiDAR Place Recognition in Forests Attentioning Multiple BEV Density Images | Yanqing Shen, Turcan Tuna, Marco Hutter, Cesar Cadena, Nanning Zheng | Place recognition is essential to maintain global consistency in large-scale localization systems. While research in urban environments has progressed significantly using LiDARs or cameras, applications in natural forest-like environments remain largely under-explored. Furthermore, forests present particular challenges due to high self-similarity and substantial variations in vegetation growth over time. In this work, we propose a robust LiDAR-based place recognition method for natural forests, ForestLPR. We hypothesize that a set of cross-sectional images of the forest's geometry at different heights contains the information needed to recognize revisiting a place. The cross-sectional images are represented by \ac{bev} density images of horizontal slices of the point cloud at different heights. Our approach utilizes a visual transformer as the shared backbone to produce sets of local descriptors and introduces a multi-BEV interaction module to attend to information at different heights adaptively. It is followed by an aggregation layer that produces a rotation-invariant place descriptor. We evaluated the efficacy of our method extensively on real-world data from public benchmarks as well as robotic datasets and compared it against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The results indicate that ForestLPR has consistently good performance on all evaluations and achieves an average increase of 7.38\% and 9.11\% on Recall@1 over the closest competitor on intra-sequence loop closure detection and inter-sequence re-localization, respectively, validating our hypothesis | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04475v1) | [https://github.com/shenyanqing1105/ForestLPR-CVPR2025](https://github.com/shenyanqing1105/ForestLPR-CVPR2025), [https://github.com/jianboqi/CSF](https://github.com/jianboqi/CSF), [https://csiro-robotics.github.io/Wild-Places](https://csiro-robotics.github.io/Wild-Places) |
| Improving Autoregressive Visual Generation with Cluster-Oriented Token Prediction | Teng Hu, Jiangning Zhang, Ran Yi, Jieyu Weng, Yabiao Wang, Xianfang Zeng, Zhucun Xue, Lizhuang Ma | Employing LLMs for visual generation has recently become a research focus. However, the existing methods primarily transfer the LLM architecture to visual generation but rarely investigate the fundamental differences between language and vision. This oversight may lead to suboptimal utilization of visual generation capabilities within the LLM framework. In this paper, we explore the characteristics of visual embedding space under the LLM framework and discover that the correlation between visual embeddings can help achieve more stable and robust generation results. We present IAR, an Improved AutoRegressive Visual Generation Method that enhances the training efficiency and generation quality of LLM-based visual generation models. Firstly, we propose a Codebook Rearrangement strategy that uses balanced k-means clustering algorithm to rearrange the visual codebook into clusters, ensuring high similarity among visual features within each cluster. Leveraging the rearranged codebook, we propose a Cluster-oriented Cross-entropy Loss that guides the model to correctly predict the cluster where the token is located. This approach ensures that even if the model predicts the wrong token index, there is a high probability the predicted token is located in the correct cluster, which significantly enhances the generation quality and robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently enhances the model training efficiency and performance from 100M to 1.4B, reducing the training time by half while achieving the same FID. Additionally, our approach can be applied to various LLM-based visual generation models and adheres to the scaling law, providing a promising direction for future research in LLM-based visual generation. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00880v1) | [https://github.com/sjtuplayer/IAR](https://github.com/sjtuplayer/IAR) |
| FirePlace: Geometric Refinements of LLM Common Sense Reasoning for 3D Object Placement | Ian Huang, Yanan Bao, Karen Truong, Howard Zhou, Cordelia Schmid, Leonidas Guibas, Alireza Fathi | Scene generation with 3D assets presents a complex challenge, requiring both high-level semantic understanding and low-level geometric reasoning. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at semantic tasks, their application to 3D scene generation is hindered by their limited grounding on 3D geometry. In this paper, we investigate how to best work with MLLMs in an object placement task. Towards this goal, we introduce a novel framework, FirePlace, that applies existing MLLMs in (1) 3D geometric reasoning and the extraction of relevant geometric details from the 3D scene, (2) constructing and solving geometric constraints on the extracted low-level geometry, and (3) pruning for final placements that conform to common sense. By combining geometric reasoning with real-world understanding of MLLMs, our method can propose object placements that satisfy both geometric constraints as well as high-level semantic common-sense considerations. Our experiments show that these capabilities allow our method to place objects more effectively in complex scenes with intricate geometry, surpassing the quality of prior work. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04919v1) | N/A |
| VisionPAD: A Vision-Centric Pre-training Paradigm for Autonomous Driving | Haiming Zhang, Wending Zhou, Yiyao Zhu, Xu Yan, Jiantao Gao, Dongfeng Bai, Yingjie Cai, Bingbing Liu, Shuguang Cui, Zhen Li | This paper introduces VisionPAD, a novel self-supervised pre-training paradigm designed for vision-centric algorithms in autonomous driving. In contrast to previous approaches that employ neural rendering with explicit depth supervision, VisionPAD utilizes more efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct multi-view representations using only images as supervision. Specifically, we introduce a self-supervised method for voxel velocity estimation. By warping voxels to adjacent frames and supervising the rendered outputs, the model effectively learns motion cues in the sequential data. Furthermore, we adopt a multi-frame photometric consistency approach to enhance geometric perception. It projects adjacent frames to the current frame based on rendered depths and relative poses, boosting the 3D geometric representation through pure image supervision. Extensive experiments on autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that VisionPAD significantly improves performance in 3D object detection, occupancy prediction and map segmentation, surpassing state-of-the-art pre-training strategies by a considerable margin. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.14716v1) | N/A |
| MITracker: Multi-View Integration for Visual Object Tracking | Mengjie Xu, Yitao Zhu, Haotian Jiang, Jiaming Li, Zhenrong Shen, Sheng Wang, Haolin Huang, Xinyu Wang, Qing Yang, Han Zhang, Qian Wang | Multi-view object tracking (MVOT) offers promising solutions to challenges such as occlusion and target loss, which are common in traditional single-view tracking. However, progress has been limited by the lack of comprehensive multi-view datasets and effective cross-view integration methods. To overcome these limitations, we compiled a Multi-View object Tracking (MVTrack) dataset of 234K high-quality annotated frames featuring 27 distinct objects across various scenes. In conjunction with this dataset, we introduce a novel MVOT method, Multi-View Integration Tracker (MITracker), to efficiently integrate multi-view object features and provide stable tracking outcomes. MITracker can track any object in video frames of arbitrary length from arbitrary viewpoints. The key advancements of our method over traditional single-view approaches come from two aspects: (1) MITracker transforms 2D image features into a 3D feature volume and compresses it into a bird's eye view (BEV) plane, facilitating inter-view information fusion; (2) we propose an attention mechanism that leverages geometric information from fused 3D feature volume to refine the tracking results at each view. MITracker outperforms existing methods on the MVTrack and GMTD datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The code and the new dataset will be available at https://mii-laboratory.github.io/MITracker/. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.20111v1) | N/A |
| Morpheus: Text-Driven 3D Gaussian Splat Shape and Color Stylization | Jamie Wynn, Zawar Qureshi, Jakub Powierza, Jamie Watson, Mohamed Sayed | Exploring real-world spaces using novel-view synthesis is fun, and reimagining those worlds in a different style adds another layer of excitement. Stylized worlds can also be used for downstream tasks where there is limited training data and a need to expand a model's training distribution. Most current novel-view synthesis stylization techniques lack the ability to convincingly change geometry. This is because any geometry change requires increased style strength which is often capped for stylization stability and consistency. In this work, we propose a new autoregressive 3D Gaussian Splatting stylization method. As part of this method, we contribute a new RGBD diffusion model that allows for strength control over appearance and shape stylization. To ensure consistency across stylized frames, we use a combination of novel depth-guided cross attention, feature injection, and a Warp ControlNet conditioned on composite frames for guiding the stylization of new frames. We validate our method via extensive qualitative results, quantitative experiments, and a user study.

| SPARC: Score Prompting and Adaptive Fusion for Zero-Shot Multi-Label Recognition in Vision-Language Models | Kevin Miller, Samarth Mishra, Aditya Gangrade, Kate Saenko, Venkatesh Saligrama | Zero-shot multi-label recognition (MLR) with Vision-Language Models (VLMs) faces significant challenges without training data, model tuning, or architectural modifications. Existing approaches require prompt tuning or architectural adaptations, limiting zero-shot applicability. Our work proposes a novel solution treating VLMs as black boxes, leveraging scores without training data or ground truth. Using large language model insights on object co-occurrence, we introduce compound prompts grounded in realistic object combinations. Analysis of these prompt scores reveals VLM biases and ``AND''/``OR'' signal ambiguities, notably that maximum compound scores are surprisingly suboptimal compared to second-highest scores. We address these through a debiasing and score-fusion algorithm that corrects image bias and clarifies VLM response behaviors. Our method enhances other zero-shot approaches, consistently improving their results. Experiments show superior mean Average Precision (mAP) compared to methods requiring training data, achieved through refined object ranking for robust zero-shot MLR. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.16911v1) | N/A |
| Unlearning through Knowledge Overwriting: Reversible Federated Unlearning via Selective Sparse Adapter | Zhengyi Zhong, Weidong Bao, Ji Wang, Shuai Zhang, Jingxuan Zhou, Lingjuan Lyu, Wei Yang Bryan Lim | Federated Learning is a promising paradigm for privacy-preserving collaborative model training. In practice, it is essential not only to continuously train the model to acquire new knowledge but also to guarantee old knowledge the right to be forgotten (i.e., federated unlearning), especially for privacy-sensitive information or harmful knowledge. However, current federated unlearning methods face several challenges, including indiscriminate unlearning of cross-client knowledge, irreversibility of unlearning, and significant unlearning costs. To this end, we propose a method named FUSED, which first identifies critical layers by analyzing each layer's sensitivity to knowledge and constructs sparse unlearning adapters for sensitive ones. Then, the adapters are trained without altering the original parameters, overwriting the unlearning knowledge with the remaining knowledge. This knowledge overwriting process enables FUSED to mitigate the effects of indiscriminate unlearning. Moreover, the introduction of independent adapters makes unlearning reversible and significantly reduces the unlearning costs. Finally, extensive experiments on three datasets across various unlearning scenarios demonstrate that FUSED's effectiveness is comparable to Retraining, surpassing all other baselines while greatly reducing unlearning costs. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.20709v1) | [https://github.com/Zhong-Zhengyi/FUSED-Code](https://github.com/Zhong-Zhengyi/FUSED-Code), [https://github.com/kentaroy47/vision-](https://github.com/kentaroy47/vision-) |
| PQPP: A Joint Benchmark for Text-to-Image Prompt and Query Performance Prediction | Eduard Poesina, Adriana Valentina Costache, Adrian-Gabriel Chifu, Josiane Mothe, Radu Tudor Ionescu | Text-to-image generation has recently emerged as a viable alternative to text-to-image retrieval, due to the visually impressive results of generative diffusion models. Although query performance prediction is an active research topic in information retrieval, to the best of our knowledge, there is no prior study that analyzes the difficulty of queries (prompts) in text-to-image generation, based on human judgments. To this end, we introduce the first dataset of prompts which are manually annotated in terms of image generation performance. In order to determine the difficulty of the same prompts in image retrieval, we also collect manual annotations that represent retrieval performance. We thus propose the first benchmark for joint text-to-image prompt and query performance prediction, comprising 10K queries. Our benchmark enables: (i) the comparative assessment of the difficulty of prompts/queries in image generation and image retrieval, and (ii) the evaluation of prompt/query performance predictors addressing both generation and retrieval. We present results with several pre-generation/retrieval and post-generation/retrieval performance predictors, thus providing competitive baselines for future research.

| SplatAD: Real-Time Lidar and Camera Rendering with 3D Gaussian Splatting for Autonomous Driving | Georg Hess, Carl Lindström, Maryam Fatemi, Christoffer Petersson, Lennart Svensson | Ensuring the safety of autonomous robots, such as self-driving vehicles, requires extensive testing across diverse driving scenarios. Simulation is a key ingredient for conducting such testing in a cost-effective and scalable way. Neural rendering methods have gained popularity, as they can build simulation environments from collected logs in a data-driven manner. However, existing neural radiance field (NeRF) methods for sensor-realistic rendering of camera and lidar data suffer from low rendering speeds, limiting their applicability for large-scale testing. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering, current methods are limited to camera data and are unable to render lidar data essential for autonomous driving. To address these limitations, we propose SplatAD, the first 3DGS-based method for realistic, real-time rendering of dynamic scenes for both camera and lidar data. SplatAD accurately models key sensor-specific phenomena such as rolling shutter effects, lidar intensity, and lidar ray dropouts, using purpose-built algorithms to optimize rendering efficiency. Evaluation across three autonomous driving datasets demonstrates that SplatAD achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality with up to +2 PSNR for NVS and +3 PSNR for reconstruction while increasing rendering speed over NeRF-based methods by an order of magnitude.

| Repurposing Pre-trained Video Diffusion Models for Event-based Video Interpolation | Jingxi Chen, Brandon Y. Feng, Haoming Cai, Tianfu Wang, Levi Burner, Dehao Yuan, Cornelia Fermuller, Christopher A. Metzler, Yiannis Aloimonos | Video Frame Interpolation aims to recover realistic missing frames between observed frames, generating a high-frame-rate video from a low-frame-rate video. However, without additional guidance, the large motion between frames makes this problem ill-posed. Event-based Video Frame Interpolation (EVFI) addresses this challenge by using sparse, high-temporal-resolution event measurements as motion guidance. This guidance allows EVFI methods to significantly outperform frame-only methods. However, to date, EVFI methods have relied on a limited set of paired event-frame training data, severely limiting their performance and generalization capabilities. In this work, we overcome the limited data challenge by adapting pre-trained video diffusion models trained on internet-scale datasets to EVFI. We experimentally validate our approach on real-world EVFI datasets, including a new one that we introduce. Our method outperforms existing methods and generalizes across cameras far better than existing approaches. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07761v1) | N/A |
| Theoretical Insights in Model Inversion Robustness and Conditional Entropy Maximization for Collaborative Inference Systems | Song Xia, Yi Yu, Wenhan Yang, Meiwen Ding, Zhuo Chen, Lingyu Duan, Alex C. Kot, Xudong Jiang | By locally encoding raw data into intermediate features, collaborative inference enables end users to leverage powerful deep learning models without exposure of sensitive raw data to cloud servers. However, recent studies have revealed that these intermediate features may not sufficiently preserve privacy, as information can be leaked and raw data can be reconstructed via model inversion attacks (MIAs). Obfuscation-based methods, such as noise corruption, adversarial representation learning, and information filters, enhance the inversion robustness by obfuscating the task-irrelevant redundancy empirically. However, methods for quantifying such redundancy remain elusive, and the explicit mathematical relation between this redundancy minimization and inversion robustness enhancement has not yet been established. To address that, this work first theoretically proves that the conditional entropy of inputs given intermediate features provides a guaranteed lower bound on the reconstruction mean square error (MSE) under any MIA. Then, we derive a differentiable and solvable measure for bounding this conditional entropy based on the Gaussian mixture estimation and propose a conditional entropy maximization (CEM) algorithm to enhance the inversion robustness. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of our proposed CEM; without compromising feature utility and computing efficiency, plugging the proposed CEM into obfuscation-based defense mechanisms consistently boosts their inversion robustness, achieving average gains ranging from 12.9\% to 48.2\%.

| FLAME: Frozen Large Language Models Enable Data-Efficient Language-Image Pre-training | Anjia Cao, Xing Wei, Zhiheng Ma | Language-image pre-training faces significant challenges due to limited data in specific formats and the constrained capacities of text encoders. While prevailing methods attempt to address these issues through data augmentation and architecture modifications, they continue to struggle with processing long-form text inputs, and the inherent limitations of traditional CLIP text encoders lead to suboptimal downstream generalization. In this paper, we propose FLAME (Frozen Large lAnguage Models Enable data-efficient language-image pre-training) that leverages frozen large language models as text encoders, naturally processing long text inputs and demonstrating impressive multilingual generalization. FLAME comprises two key components: 1) a multifaceted prompt distillation technique for extracting diverse semantic representations from long captions, which better aligns with the multifaceted nature of images, and 2) a facet-decoupled attention mechanism, complemented by an offline embedding strategy, to ensure efficient computation.

| Joint Out-of-Distribution Filtering and Data Discovery Active Learning | Sebastian Schmidt, Leonard Schenk, Leo Schwinn, Stephan Günnemann | As the data demand for deep learning models increases, active learning (AL) becomes essential to strategically select samples for labeling, which maximizes data efficiency and reduces training costs. Real-world scenarios necessitate the consideration of incomplete data knowledge within AL. Prior works address handling out-of-distribution (OOD) data, while another research direction has focused on category discovery. However, a combined analysis of real-world considerations combining AL with out-of-distribution data and category discovery remains unexplored. To address this gap, we propose Joint Out-of-distribution filtering and data Discovery Active learning (Joda) , to uniquely address both challenges simultaneously by filtering out OOD data before selecting candidates for labeling. In contrast to previous methods, we deeply entangle the training procedure with filter and selection to construct a common feature space that aligns known and novel categories while separating OOD samples. Unlike previous works, Joda is highly efficient and completely omits auxiliary models and training access to the unlabeled pool for filtering or selection. In extensive experiments on 18 configurations and 3 metrics, \ours{} consistently achieves the highest accuracy with the best class discovery to OOD filtering balance compared to state-of-the-art competitor approaches. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.02491v1) | N/A |
| Multimodal Autoregressive Pre-training of Large Vision Encoders | Enrico Fini, Mustafa Shukor, Xiujun Li, Philipp Dufter, Michal Klein, David Haldimann, Sai Aitharaju, Victor Guilherme Turrisi da Costa, Louis Béthune, Zhe Gan, Alexander T Toshev, Marcin Eichner, Moin Nabi, Yinfei Yang, Joshua M. Susskind, Alaaeldin El-Nouby | We introduce a novel method for pre-training of large-scale vision encoders. Building on recent advancements in autoregressive pre-training of vision models, we extend this framework to a multimodal setting, i.e., images and text. In this paper, we present AIMV2, a family of generalist vision encoders characterized by a straightforward pre-training process, scalability, and remarkable performance across a range of downstream tasks. This is achieved by pairing the vision encoder with a multimodal decoder that autoregressively generates raw image patches and text tokens. Our encoders excel not only in multimodal evaluations but also in vision benchmarks such as localization, grounding, and classification. Notably, our AIMV2-3B encoder achieves 89.5% accuracy on ImageNet-1k with a frozen trunk. Furthermore, AIMV2 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art contrastive models (e.g., CLIP, SigLIP) in multimodal image understanding across diverse settings. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.14402v1) | [https://github.com/apple/ml-aim](https://github.com/apple/ml-aim) |
| Fast and Accurate Gigapixel Pathological Image Classification with Hierarchical Distillation Multi-Instance Learning | Jiuyang Dong, Junjun Jiang, Kui Jiang, Jiahan Li, Yongbing Zhang | Although multi-instance learning (MIL) has succeeded in pathological image classification, it faces the challenge of high inference costs due to processing numerous patches from gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs). To address this, we propose HDMIL, a hierarchical distillation multi-instance learning framework that achieves fast and accurate classification by eliminating irrelevant patches. HDMIL consists of two key components: the dynamic multi-instance network (DMIN) and the lightweight instance pre-screening network (LIPN). DMIN operates on high-resolution WSIs, while LIPN operates on the corresponding low-resolution counterparts. During training, DMIN are trained for WSI classification while generating attention-score-based masks that indicate irrelevant patches. These masks then guide the training of LIPN to predict the relevance of each low-resolution patch. During testing, LIPN first determines the useful regions within low-resolution WSIs, which indirectly enables us to eliminate irrelevant regions in high-resolution WSIs, thereby reducing inference time without causing performance degradation. In addition, we further design the first Chebyshev-polynomials-based Kolmogorov-Arnold classifier in computational pathology, which enhances the performance of HDMIL through learnable activation layers. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that HDMIL outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, e.g., achieving improvements of 3.13% in AUC while reducing inference time by 28.6% on the Camelyon16 dataset. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.21130v2) | [https://github.com/JiuyangDong/HDMIL](https://github.com/JiuyangDong/HDMIL) |
| Learnable Infinite Taylor Gaussian for Dynamic View Rendering | Bingbing Hu, Yanyan Li, Rui Xie, Bo Xu, Haoye Dong, Junfeng Yao, Gim Hee Lee | Capturing the temporal evolution of Gaussian properties such as position, rotation, and scale is a challenging task due to the vast number of time-varying parameters and the limited photometric data available, which generally results in convergence issues, making it difficult to find an optimal solution. While feeding all inputs into an end-to-end neural network can effectively model complex temporal dynamics, this approach lacks explicit supervision and struggles to generate high-quality transformation fields. On the other hand, using time-conditioned polynomial functions to model Gaussian trajectories and orientations provides a more explicit and interpretable solution, but requires significant handcrafted effort and lacks generalizability across diverse scenes. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a novel approach based on a learnable infinite Taylor Formula to model the temporal evolution of Gaussians. This method offers both the flexibility of an implicit network-based approach and the interpretability of explicit polynomial functions, allowing for more robust and generalizable modeling of Gaussian dynamics across various dynamic scenes. Extensive experiments on dynamic novel view rendering tasks are conducted on public datasets, demonstrating that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in this domain.

As LMMs continue to improve, it is increasingly important to ensure they understand cultural contexts, respect local sensitivities, and support low-resource languages, all while effectively integrating corresponding visual cues. In pursuit of culturally diverse global multimodal models, our proposed All Languages Matter Benchmark (ALM-bench) represents the largest and most comprehensive effort to date for evaluating LMMs across 100 languages. ALM-bench challenges existing models by testing their ability to understand and reason about culturally diverse images paired with text in various languages, including many low-resource languages traditionally underrepresented in LMM research. The benchmark offers a robust and nuanced evaluation framework featuring various question formats, including true/false, multiple choice, and open-ended questions, which are further divided into short and long-answer categories. ALM-bench design ensures a comprehensive assessment of a model's ability to handle varied levels of difficulty in visual and linguistic reasoning. To capture the rich tapestry of global cultures, ALM-bench carefully curates content from 13 distinct cultural aspects, ranging from traditions and rituals to famous personalities and celebrations. Through this, ALM-bench not only provides a rigorous testing ground for state-of-the-art open and closed-source LMMs but also highlights the importance of cultural and linguistic inclusivity, encouraging the development of models that can serve diverse global populations effectively. Our benchmark is publicly available. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16508v2) | [https://mbzuai-oryx.github.io/ALM-Bench](https://mbzuai-oryx.github.io/ALM-Bench) |
| Efficient Fine-Tuning and Concept Suppression for Pruned Diffusion Models | Reza Shirkavand, Peiran Yu, Shangqian Gao, Gowthami Somepalli, Tom Goldstein, Heng Huang | Recent advances in diffusion generative models have yielded remarkable progress. While the quality of generated content continues to improve, these models have grown considerably in size and complexity. This increasing computational burden poses significant challenges, particularly in resource-constrained deployment scenarios such as mobile devices. The combination of model pruning and knowledge distillation has emerged as a promising solution to reduce computational demands while preserving generation quality. However, this technique inadvertently propagates undesirable behaviors, including the generation of copyrighted content and unsafe concepts, even when such instances are absent from the fine-tuning dataset. In this paper, we propose a novel bilevel optimization framework for pruned diffusion models that consolidates the fine-tuning and unlearning processes into a unified phase. Our approach maintains the principal advantages of distillation-namely, efficient convergence and style transfer capabilities-while selectively suppressing the generation of unwanted content. This plug-in framework is compatible with various pruning and concept unlearning methods, facilitating efficient, safe deployment of diffusion models in controlled environments. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15341v1) | N/A |
| Divide and Conquer: Heterogeneous Noise Integration for Diffusion-based Adversarial Purification | Gaozheng Pei, Shaojie Lyu, Gong Chen, Ke Ma, Qianqian Xu, Yingfei Sun, Qingming Huang | Existing diffusion-based purification methods aim to disrupt adversarial perturbations by introducing a certain amount of noise through a forward diffusion process, followed by a reverse process to recover clean examples. However, this approach is fundamentally flawed: the uniform operation of the forward process across all pixels compromises normal pixels while attempting to combat adversarial perturbations, resulting in the target model producing incorrect predictions. Simply relying on low-intensity noise is insufficient for effective defense. To address this critical issue, we implement a heterogeneous purification strategy grounded in the interpretability of neural networks. Our method decisively applies higher-intensity noise to specific pixels that the target model focuses on while the remaining pixels are subjected to only low-intensity noise. This requirement motivates us to redesign the sampling process of the diffusion model, allowing for the effective removal of varying noise levels. Furthermore, to evaluate our method against strong adaptative attack, our proposed method sharply reduces time cost and memory usage through a single-step resampling. The empirical evidence from extensive experiments across three datasets demonstrates that our method outperforms most current adversarial training and purification techniques by a substantial margin. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.01407v1) | [https://github.com/MadryLab/robustness](https://github.com/MadryLab/robustness) |
| Unbiased Video Scene Graph Generation via Visual and Semantic Dual Debiasing | Yanjun Li, Zhaoyang Li, Honghui Chen, Lizhi Xu | Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) aims to capture dynamic relationships among entities by sequentially analyzing video frames and integrating visual and semantic information. However, VidSGG is challenged by significant biases that skew predictions. To mitigate these biases, we propose a VIsual and Semantic Awareness (VISA) framework for unbiased VidSGG. VISA addresses visual bias through memory-enhanced temporal integration that enhances object representations and concurrently reduces semantic bias by iteratively integrating object features with comprehensive semantic information derived from triplet relationships. This visual-semantics dual debiasing approach results in more unbiased representations of complex scene dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, where VISA outperforms existing unbiased VidSGG approaches by a substantial margin (e.g., +13.1% improvement in mR@20 and mR@50 for the SGCLS task under Semi Constraint). | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00548v1) | N/A |
| Skip Tuning: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models are Effective and Efficient Adapters Themselves | Shihan Wu, Ji Zhang, Pengpeng Zeng, Lianli Gao, Jingkuan Song, Heng Tao Shen | Prompt tuning (PT) has long been recognized as an effective and efficient paradigm for transferring large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to downstream tasks by learning a tiny set of context vectors. Nevertheless, in this work, we reveal that freezing the parameters of VLMs during learning the context vectors neither facilitates the transferability of pre-trained knowledge nor improves the memory and time efficiency significantly. Upon further investigation, we find that reducing both the length and width of the feature-gradient propagation flows of the full fine-tuning (FT) baseline is key to achieving effective and efficient knowledge transfer. Motivated by this, we propose Skip Tuning, a novel paradigm for adapting VLMs to downstream tasks. Unlike existing PT or adapter-based methods, Skip Tuning applies Layer-wise Skipping (LSkip) and Class-wise Skipping (CSkip) upon the FT baseline without introducing extra context vectors or adapter modules. Extensive experiments across a wide spectrum of benchmarks demonstrate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of our Skip Tuning over both PT and adapter-based methods.

| StageDesigner: Artistic Stage Generation for Scenography via Theater Scripts | Zhaoxing Gan, Mengtian Li, Ruhua Chen, Zhongxia Ji, Sichen Guo, Huanling Hu, Guangnan Ye, Zuo Hu | In this work, we introduce StageDesigner, the first comprehensive framework for artistic stage generation using large language models combined with layout-controlled diffusion models. Given the professional requirements of stage scenography, StageDesigner simulates the workflows of seasoned artists to generate immersive 3D stage scenes. Specifically, our approach is divided into three primary modules: Script Analysis, which extracts thematic and spatial cues from input scripts; Foreground Generation, which constructs and arranges essential 3D objects; and Background Generation, which produces a harmonious background aligned with the narrative atmosphere and maintains spatial coherence by managing occlusions between foreground and background elements. Furthermore, we introduce the StagePro-V1 dataset, a dedicated dataset with 276 unique stage scenes spanning different historical styles and annotated with scripts, images, and detailed 3D layouts, specifically tailored for this task. Finally, evaluations using both standard and newly proposed metrics, along with extensive user studies, demonstrate the effectiveness of StageDesigner.

| PhyT2V: LLM-Guided Iterative Self-Refinement for Physics-Grounded Text-to-Video Generation | Qiyao Xue, Xiangyu Yin, Boyuan Yang, Wei Gao | Text-to-video (T2V) generation has been recently enabled by transformer-based diffusion models, but current T2V models lack capabilities in adhering to the real-world common knowledge and physical rules, due to their limited understanding of physical realism and deficiency in temporal modeling. Existing solutions are either data-driven or require extra model inputs, but cannot be generalizable to out-of-distribution domains. In this paper, we present PhyT2V, a new data-independent T2V technique that expands the current T2V model's capability of video generation to out-of-distribution domains, by enabling chain-of-thought and step-back reasoning in T2V prompting. Our experiments show that PhyT2V improves existing T2V models' adherence to real-world physical rules by 2.3x, and achieves 35% improvement compared to T2V prompt enhancers.

| Devils in Middle Layers of Large Vision-Language Models: Interpreting, Detecting and Mitigating Object Hallucinations via Attention Lens | Zhangqi Jiang, Junkai Chen, Beier Zhu, Tingjin Luo, Yankun Shen, Xu Yang | Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) significantly undermine their reliability, motivating researchers to explore the causes of hallucination. However, most studies primarily focus on the language aspect rather than the visual. In this paper, we address how LVLMs process visual information and whether this process causes hallucination. Firstly, we use the attention lens to identify the stages at which LVLMs handle visual data, discovering that the middle layers are crucial. Moreover, we find that these layers can be further divided into two stages: "visual information enrichment" and "semantic refinement" which respectively propagate visual data to object tokens and interpret it through text. By analyzing attention patterns during the visual information enrichment stage, we find that real tokens consistently receive higher attention weights than hallucinated ones, serving as a strong indicator of hallucination. Further examination of multi-head attention maps reveals that hallucination tokens often result from heads interacting with inconsistent objects. Based on these insights, we propose a simple inference-time method that adjusts visual attention by integrating information across various heads. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this approach effectively mitigates hallucinations in mainstream LVLMs without additional training costs. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16724v2) | N/A |
| AirRoom: Objects Matter in Room Reidentification | Runmao Yao, Yi Du, Zhuoqun Chen, Haoze Zheng, Chen Wang | Room reidentification (ReID) is a challenging yet essential task with numerous applications in fields such as augmented reality (AR) and homecare robotics. Existing visual place recognition (VPR) methods, which typically rely on global descriptors or aggregate local features, often struggle in cluttered indoor environments densely populated with man-made objects. These methods tend to overlook the crucial role of object-oriented information. To address this, we propose AirRoom, an object-aware pipeline that integrates multi-level object-oriented information-from global context to object patches, object segmentation, and keypoints-utilizing a coarse-to-fine retrieval approach. Extensive experiments on four newly constructed datasets-MPReID, HMReID, GibsonReID, and ReplicaReID-demonstrate that AirRoom outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models across nearly all evaluation metrics, with improvements ranging from 6% to 80%. Moreover, AirRoom exhibits significant flexibility, allowing various modules within the pipeline to be substituted with different alternatives without compromising overall performance. It also shows robust and consistent performance under diverse viewpoint variations. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.01130v1) | N/A |
| Dynamic Integration of Task-Specific Adapters for Class Incremental Learning | Jiashuo Li, Shaokun Wang, Bo Qian, Yuhang He, Xing Wei, Yihong Gong | Non-exemplar class Incremental Learning (NECIL) enables models to continuously acquire new classes without retraining from scratch and storing old task exemplars, addressing privacy and storage issues. However, the absence of data from earlier tasks exacerbates the challenge of catastrophic forgetting in NECIL. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Dynamic Integration of task-specific Adapters (DIA), which comprises two key components: Task-Specific Adapter Integration (TSAI) and Patch-Level Model Alignment. TSAI boosts compositionality through a patch-level adapter integration strategy, which provides a more flexible compositional solution while maintaining low computation costs. Patch-Level Model Alignment maintains feature consistency and accurate decision boundaries via two specialized mechanisms: Patch-Level Distillation Loss (PDL) and Patch-Level Feature Reconstruction method (PFR). Specifically, the PDL preserves feature-level consistency between successive models by implementing a distillation loss based on the contributions of patch tokens to new class learning. The PFR facilitates accurate classifier alignment by reconstructing old class features from previous tasks that adapt to new task knowledge. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our DIA, revealing significant improvements on benchmark datasets in the NECIL setting, maintaining an optimal balance between computational complexity and accuracy. The full code implementation will be made publicly available upon the publication of this paper. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14983v1) | N/A |
| DiTASK: Multi-Task Fine-Tuning with Diffeomorphic Transformations | Krishna Sri Ipsit Mantri, Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb, Bruno Ribeiro, Chaim Baskin, Moshe Eliasof | Pre-trained Vision Transformers now serve as powerful tools for computer vision. Yet, efficiently adapting them for multiple tasks remains a challenge that arises from the need to modify the rich hidden representations encoded by the learned weight matrices, without inducing interference between tasks. Current parameter-efficient methods like LoRA, which apply low-rank updates, force tasks to compete within constrained subspaces, ultimately degrading performance. We introduce DiTASK a novel Diffeomorphic Multi-Task Fine-Tuning approach that maintains pre-trained representations by preserving weight matrix singular vectors, while enabling task-specific adaptations through neural diffeomorphic transformations of the singular values. By following this approach, DiTASK enables both shared and task-specific feature modulations with minimal added parameters. Our theoretical analysis shows that DITASK achieves full-rank updates during optimization, preserving the geometric structure of pre-trained features, and establishing a new paradigm for efficient multi-task learning (MTL). Our experiments on PASCAL MTL and NYUD show that DiTASK achieves state-of-the-art performance across four dense prediction tasks, using 75% fewer parameters than existing methods.

| EfficientViM: Efficient Vision Mamba with Hidden State Mixer based State Space Duality | Sanghyeok Lee, Joonmyung Choi, Hyunwoo J. Kim | For the deployment of neural networks in resource-constrained environments, prior works have built lightweight architectures with convolution and attention for capturing local and global dependencies, respectively. Recently, the state space model has emerged as an effective global token interaction with its favorable linear computational cost in the number of tokens. Yet, efficient vision backbones built with SSM have been explored less. In this paper, we introduce Efficient Vision Mamba (EfficientViM), a novel architecture built on hidden state mixer-based state space duality (HSM-SSD) that efficiently captures global dependencies with further reduced computational cost. In the HSM-SSD layer, we redesign the previous SSD layer to enable the channel mixing operation within hidden states. Additionally, we propose multi-stage hidden state fusion to further reinforce the representation power of hidden states, and provide the design alleviating the bottleneck caused by the memory-bound operations. As a result, the EfficientViM family achieves a new state-of-the-art speed-accuracy trade-off on ImageNet-1k, offering up to a 0.7% performance improvement over the second-best model SHViT with faster speed. Further, we observe significant improvements in throughput and accuracy compared to prior works, when scaling images or employing distillation training.

| CGMatch: A Different Perspective of Semi-supervised Learning | Bo Cheng, Jueqing Lu, Yuan Tian, Haifeng Zhao, Yi Chang, Lan Du | Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has garnered significant attention due to its ability to leverage limited labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data to improve model generalization performance. Recent approaches achieve impressive successes by combining ideas from both consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling. However, these methods tend to underperform in the more realistic situations with relatively scarce labeled data. We argue that this issue arises because existing methods rely solely on the model's confidence, making them challenging to accurately assess the model's state and identify unlabeled examples contributing to the training phase when supervision information is limited, especially during the early stages of model training. In this paper, we propose a novel SSL model called CGMatch, which, for the first time, incorporates a new metric known as Count-Gap (CG). We demonstrate that CG is effective in discovering unlabeled examples beneficial for model training. Along with confidence, a commonly used metric in SSL, we propose a fine-grained dynamic selection (FDS) strategy. This strategy dynamically divides the unlabeled dataset into three subsets with different characteristics: easy-to-learn set, ambiguous set, and hard-to-learn set. By selective filtering subsets, and applying corresponding regularization with selected subsets, we mitigate the negative impact of incorrect pseudo-labels on model optimization and generalization. Extensive experimental results on several common SSL benchmarks indicate the effectiveness of CGMatch especially when the labeled data are particularly limited.

| Latent Space Imaging | Matheus Souza, Yidan Zheng, Kaizhang Kang, Yogeshwar Nath Mishra, Qiang Fu, Wolfgang Heidrich | Digital imaging systems have classically been based on brute-force measuring and processing of pixels organized on regular grids. The human visual system, on the other hand, performs a massive data reduction from the number of photo-receptors to the optic nerve, essentially encoding the image information into a low bandwidth latent space representation suitable for processing by the human brain. In this work, we propose to follow a similar approach for the development of artificial vision systems. Latent Space Imaging is a new paradigm that, through a combination of optics and software, directly encodes the image information into the semantically rich latent space of a generative model, thus substantially reducing bandwidth and memory requirements during the capture process. We demonstrate this new principle through an initial hardware prototype based on the single pixel camera. By designing an amplitude modulation scheme that encodes into the latent space of a generative model, we achieve compression ratios from 1:100 to 1:1,000 during the imaging process, illustrating the potential of latent space imaging for highly efficient imaging hardware, to enable future applications in high speed imaging, or task-specific cameras with substantially reduced hardware complexity. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07052v1) | N/A |
| SVDC: Consistent Direct Time-of-Flight Video Depth Completion with Frequency Selective Fusion | Xuan Zhu, Jijun Xiang, Xianqi Wang, Longliang Liu, Yu Wang, Hong Zhang, Fei Guo, Xin Yang | Lightweight direct Time-of-Flight (dToF) sensors are ideal for 3D sensing on mobile devices. However, due to the manufacturing constraints of compact devices and the inherent physical principles of imaging, dToF depth maps are sparse and noisy. In this paper, we propose a novel video depth completion method, called SVDC, by fusing the sparse dToF data with the corresponding RGB guidance. Our method employs a multi-frame fusion scheme to mitigate the spatial ambiguity resulting from the sparse dToF imaging. Misalignment between consecutive frames during multi-frame fusion could cause blending between object edges and the background, which results in a loss of detail. To address this, we introduce an adaptive frequency selective fusion (AFSF) module, which automatically selects convolution kernel sizes to fuse multi-frame features. Our AFSF utilizes a channel-spatial enhancement attention (CSEA) module to enhance features and generates an attention map as fusion weights. The AFSF ensures edge detail recovery while suppressing high-frequency noise in smooth regions. To further enhance temporal consistency, We propose a cross-window consistency loss to ensure consistent predictions across different windows, effectively reducing flickering. Our proposed SVDC achieves optimal accuracy and consistency on the TartanAir and Dynamic Replica datasets.

| Unleashing the Potential of Multi-modal Foundation Models and Video Diffusion for 4D Dynamic Physical Scene Simulation | Zhuoman Liu, Weicai Ye, Yan Luximon, Pengfei Wan, Di Zhang | Realistic simulation of dynamic scenes requires accurately capturing diverse material properties and modeling complex object interactions grounded in physical principles. However, existing methods are constrained to basic material types with limited predictable parameters, making them insufficient to represent the complexity of real-world materials. We introduce a novel approach that leverages multi-modal foundation models and video diffusion to achieve enhanced 4D dynamic scene simulation. Our method utilizes multi-modal models to identify material types and initialize material parameters through image queries, while simultaneously inferring 3D Gaussian splats for detailed scene representation. We further refine these material parameters using video diffusion with a differentiable Material Point Method (MPM) and optical flow guidance rather than render loss or Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss. This integrated framework enables accurate prediction and realistic simulation of dynamic interactions in real-world scenarios, advancing both accuracy and flexibility in physics-based simulations. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.14423v1) | [https://github.com/nvidia/warp](https://github.com/nvidia/warp), [https://zhuomanliu.github.io/PhysFlow](https://zhuomanliu.github.io/PhysFlow) |

MapDR features over $10,000$ annotated video clips that capture the intricate correlation between traffic sign regulations and lanes. Built upon this benchmark and the newly defined task of integrating traffic regulations into online HD maps, we provide modular and end-to-end solutions: VLE-MEE and RuleVLM, offering a strong baseline for advancing autonomous driving technology. It fills a critical gap in the integration of traffic sign rules, contributing to the development of reliable autonomous driving systems. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.23780v2) | N/A |
| Olympus: A Universal Task Router for Computer Vision Tasks | Yuanze Lin, Yunsheng Li, Dongdong Chen, Weijian Xu, Ronald Clark, Philip H. S. Torr | We introduce Olympus, a new approach that transforms Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into a unified framework capable of handling a wide array of computer vision tasks. Utilizing a controller MLLM, Olympus delegates over 20 specialized tasks across images, videos, and 3D objects to dedicated modules. This instruction-based routing enables complex workflows through chained actions without the need for training heavy generative models. Olympus easily integrates with existing MLLMs, expanding their capabilities with comparable performance. Experimental results demonstrate that Olympus achieves an average routing accuracy of 94.75% across 20 tasks and precision of 91.82% in chained action scenarios, showcasing its effectiveness as a universal task router that can solve a diverse range of computer vision tasks.

| Search and Detect: Training-Free Long Tail Object Detection via Web-Image Retrieval | Mankeerat Sidhu, Hetarth Chopra, Ansel Blume, Jeonghwan Kim, Revanth Gangi Reddy, Heng Ji | In this paper, we introduce SearchDet, a training-free long-tail object detection framework that significantly enhances open-vocabulary object detection performance. SearchDet retrieves a set of positive and negative images of an object to ground, embeds these images, and computes an input image-weighted query which is used to detect the desired concept in the image. Our proposed method is simple and training-free, yet achieves over 48.7% mAP improvement on ODinW and 59.1% mAP improvement on LVIS compared to state-of-the-art models such as GroundingDINO. We further show that our approach of basing object detection on a set of Web-retrieved exemplars is stable with respect to variations in the exemplars, suggesting a path towards eliminating costly data annotation and training procedures. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18733v1) | N/A |
| ASAP: Advancing Semantic Alignment Promotes Multi-Modal Manipulation Detecting and Grounding | Zhenxing Zhang, Yaxiong Wang, Lechao Cheng, Zhun Zhong, Dan Guo, Meng Wang | We present ASAP, a new framework for detecting and grounding multi-modal media manipulation (DGM4).Upon thorough examination, we observe that accurate fine-grained cross-modal semantic alignment between the image and text is vital for accurately manipulation detection and grounding. While existing DGM4 methods pay rare attention to the cross-modal alignment, hampering the accuracy of manipulation detecting to step further. To remedy this issue, this work targets to advance the semantic alignment learning to promote this task. Particularly, we utilize the off-the-shelf Multimodal Large-Language Models (MLLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to construct paired image-text pairs, especially for the manipulated instances. Subsequently, a cross-modal alignment learning is performed to enhance the semantic alignment. Besides the explicit auxiliary clues, we further design a Manipulation-Guided Cross Attention (MGCA) to provide implicit guidance for augmenting the manipulation perceiving. With the grounding truth available during training, MGCA encourages the model to concentrate more on manipulated components while downplaying normal ones, enhancing the model's ability to capture manipulations. Extensive experiments are conducted on the DGM4 dataset, the results demonstrate that our model can surpass the comparison method with a clear margin. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12718v1) | [https://github.com/CriliasMiller/ASAP](https://github.com/CriliasMiller/ASAP) |
| SpiritSight Agent: Advanced GUI Agent with One Look | Zhiyuan Huang, Ziming Cheng, Junting Pan, Zhaohui Hou, Mingjie Zhan | Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents show amazing abilities in assisting human-computer interaction, automating human user's navigation on digital devices. An ideal GUI agent is expected to achieve high accuracy, low latency, and compatibility for different GUI platforms. Recent vision-based approaches have shown promise by leveraging advanced Vision Language Models (VLMs). While they generally meet the requirements of compatibility and low latency, these vision-based GUI agents tend to have low accuracy due to their limitations in element grounding. To address this issue, we propose $\textbf{SpiritSight}$, a vision-based, end-to-end GUI agent that excels in GUI navigation tasks across various GUI platforms. First, we create a multi-level, large-scale, high-quality GUI dataset called $\textbf{GUI-Lasagne}$ using scalable methods, empowering SpiritSight with robust GUI understanding and grounding capabilities. Second, we introduce the $\textbf{Universal Block Parsing (UBP)}$ method to resolve the ambiguity problem in dynamic high-resolution of visual inputs, further enhancing SpiritSight's ability to ground GUI objects. Through these efforts, SpiritSight agent outperforms other advanced methods on diverse GUI benchmarks, demonstrating its superior capability and compatibility in GUI navigation tasks.

| SharpDepth: Sharpening Metric Depth Predictions Using Diffusion Distillation | Duc-Hai Pham, Tung Do, Phong Nguyen, Binh-Son Hua, Khoi Nguyen, Rang Nguyen | We propose SharpDepth, a novel approach to monocular metric depth estimation that combines the metric accuracy of discriminative depth estimation methods (e.g., Metric3D, UniDepth) with the fine-grained boundary sharpness typically achieved by generative methods (e.g., Marigold, Lotus). Traditional discriminative models trained on real-world data with sparse ground-truth depth can accurately predict metric depth but often produce over-smoothed or low-detail depth maps. Generative models, in contrast, are trained on synthetic data with dense ground truth, generating depth maps with sharp boundaries yet only providing relative depth with low accuracy. Our approach bridges these limitations by integrating metric accuracy with detailed boundary preservation, resulting in depth predictions that are both metrically precise and visually sharp. Our extensive zero-shot evaluations on standard depth estimation benchmarks confirm SharpDepth effectiveness, showing its ability to achieve both high depth accuracy and detailed representation, making it well-suited for applications requiring high-quality depth perception across diverse, real-world environments. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18229v1) | N/A |
| OmniGen: Unified Image Generation | Shitao Xiao, Yueze Wang, Junjie Zhou, Huaying Yuan, Xingrun Xing, Ruiran Yan, Chaofan Li, Shuting Wang, Tiejun Huang, Zheng Liu | The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has unified language generation tasks and revolutionized human-machine interaction. However, in the realm of image generation, a unified model capable of handling various tasks within a single framework remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce OmniGen, a new diffusion model for unified image generation. OmniGen is characterized by the following features: 1) Unification: OmniGen not only demonstrates text-to-image generation capabilities but also inherently supports various downstream tasks, such as image editing, subject-driven generation, and visual-conditional generation. 2) Simplicity: The architecture of OmniGen is highly simplified, eliminating the need for additional plugins. Moreover, compared to existing diffusion models, it is more user-friendly and can complete complex tasks end-to-end through instructions without the need for extra intermediate steps, greatly simplifying the image generation workflow. 3) Knowledge Transfer: Benefit from learning in a unified format, OmniGen effectively transfers knowledge across different tasks, manages unseen tasks and domains, and exhibits novel capabilities. We also explore the model's reasoning capabilities and potential applications of the chain-of-thought mechanism. This work represents the first attempt at a general-purpose image generation model, and we will release our resources at https://github.com/VectorSpaceLab/OmniGen to foster future advancements. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11340v2) | [https://github.com/lllyasviel/Paints-UNDO](https://github.com/lllyasviel/Paints-UNDO), [https://github.com/explosion/spaCy](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy), [https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-large-patch14-336](https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-large-patch14-336), [https://huggingface.co/blog/instruction-tuning-sd](https://huggingface.co/blog/instruction-tuning-sd), [https://huggingface.co/spaces/yanze](https://huggingface.co/spaces/yanze), [https://huggingface.co/datasets/UCSC-VLAA](https://huggingface.co/datasets/UCSC-VLAA) |
| RAD: Region-Aware Diffusion Models for Image Inpainting | Sora Kim, Sungho Suh, Minsik Lee | Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation, with applications broadening across various domains. Inpainting is one such application that can benefit significantly from diffusion models. Existing methods either hijack the reverse process of a pretrained diffusion model or cast the problem into a larger framework, \ie, conditioned generation. However, these approaches often require nested loops in the generation process or additional components for conditioning. In this paper, we present region-aware diffusion models (RAD) for inpainting with a simple yet effective reformulation of the vanilla diffusion models. RAD utilizes a different noise schedule for each pixel, which allows local regions to be generated asynchronously while considering the global image context. A plain reverse process requires no additional components, enabling RAD to achieve inference time up to 100 times faster than the state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, we employ low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune RAD based on other pretrained diffusion models, reducing computational burdens in training as well. Experiments demonstrated that RAD provides state-of-the-art results both qualitatively and quantitatively, on the FFHQ, LSUN Bedroom, and ImageNet datasets. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09191v3) | N/A |
| LayoutVLM: Differentiable Optimization of 3D Layout via Vision-Language Models | Fan-Yun Sun, Weiyu Liu, Siyi Gu, Dylan Lim, Goutam Bhat, Federico Tombari, Manling Li, Nick Haber, Jiajun Wu | Open-universe 3D layout generation arranges unlabeled 3D assets conditioned on language instruction. Large language models (LLMs) struggle with generating physically plausible 3D scenes and adherence to input instructions, particularly in cluttered scenes. We introduce LayoutVLM, a framework and scene layout representation that exploits the semantic knowledge of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and supports differentiable optimization to ensure physical plausibility. LayoutVLM employs VLMs to generate two mutually reinforcing representations from visually marked images, and a self-consistent decoding process to improve VLMs spatial planning. Our experiments show that LayoutVLM addresses the limitations of existing LLM and constraint-based approaches, producing physically plausible 3D layouts better aligned with the semantic intent of input language instructions. We also demonstrate that fine-tuning VLMs with the proposed scene layout representation extracted from existing scene datasets can improve performance. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02193v1) | N/A |
| AToM: Aligning Text-to-Motion Model at Event-Level with GPT-4Vision Reward | Haonan Han, Xiangzuo Wu, Huan Liao, Zunnan Xu, Zhongyuan Hu, Ronghui Li, Yachao Zhang, Xiu Li | Recently, text-to-motion models have opened new possibilities for creating realistic human motion with greater efficiency and flexibility. However, aligning motion generation with event-level textual descriptions presents unique challenges due to the complex relationship between textual prompts and desired motion outcomes. To address this, we introduce AToM, a framework that enhances the alignment between generated motion and text prompts by leveraging reward from GPT-4Vision. AToM comprises three main stages: Firstly, we construct a dataset MotionPrefer that pairs three types of event-level textual prompts with generated motions, which cover the integrity, temporal relationship and frequency of motion. Secondly, we design a paradigm that utilizes GPT-4Vision for detailed motion annotation, including visual data formatting, task-specific instructions and scoring rules for each sub-task. Finally, we fine-tune an existing text-to-motion model using reinforcement learning guided by this paradigm. Experimental results demonstrate that AToM significantly improves the event-level alignment quality of text-to-motion generation. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18654v1) | [https://github.com/huggingface/peft](https://github.com/huggingface/peft), [https://huggingface.co/OpenMotionLab/MotionGPT-base](https://huggingface.co/OpenMotionLab/MotionGPT-base) |
| Discriminative Fine-tuning of LVLMs | Yassine Ouali, Adrian Bulat, Alexandros Xenos, Anestis Zaganidis, Ioannis Maniadis Metaxas, Brais Martinez, Georgios Tzimiropoulos | Contrastively-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP have become the de facto approach for discriminative vision-language representation learning. However, these models have limited language understanding, often exhibiting a "bag of words" behavior. At the same time, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which combine vision encoders with LLMs, have been shown capable of detailed vision-language reasoning, yet their autoregressive nature renders them less suitable for discriminative tasks.   In this work, we propose to combine "the best of both worlds": a new training approach for discriminative fine-tuning of LVLMs that results in strong discriminative and compositional capabilities. Essentially, our approach converts a generative LVLM into a discriminative one, unlocking its capability for powerful image-text discrimination combined with enhanced language understanding.   Our contributions include: (1) A carefully designed training/optimization framework that utilizes image-text pairs of variable length and granularity for training the model with both contrastive and next-token prediction losses. This is accompanied by ablation studies that justify the necessity of our framework's components. (2) A parameter-efficient adaptation method using a combination of soft prompting and LoRA adapters. (3) Significant improvements over state-of-the-art CLIP-like models of similar size, including standard image-text retrieval benchmarks and notable gains in compositionality. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04378v2) | N/A |
| DreamCache: Finetuning-Free Lightweight Personalized Image Generation via Feature Caching | Emanuele Aiello, Umberto Michieli, Diego Valsesia, Mete Ozay, Enrico Magli | Personalized image generation requires text-to-image generative models that capture the core features of a reference subject to allow for controlled generation across different contexts. Existing methods face challenges due to complex training requirements, high inference costs, limited flexibility, or a combination of these issues. In this paper, we introduce DreamCache, a scalable approach for efficient and high-quality personalized image generation. By caching a small number of reference image features from a subset of layers and a single timestep of the pretrained diffusion denoiser, DreamCache enables dynamic modulation of the generated image features through lightweight, trained conditioning adapters. DreamCache achieves state-of-the-art image and text alignment, utilizing an order of magnitude fewer extra parameters, and is both more computationally effective and versatile than existing models. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.17786v1) | [https://github.com/luca-medeiros/lang-segment-anything](https://github.com/luca-medeiros/lang-segment-anything) |
| 3D Prior is All You Need: Cross-Task Few-shot 2D Gaze Estimation | Yihua Cheng, Hengfei Wang, Zhongqun Zhang, Yang Yue, Bo Eun Kim, Feng Lu, Hyung Jin Chang | 3D and 2D gaze estimation share the fundamental objective of capturing eye movements but are traditionally treated as two distinct research domains. In this paper, we introduce a novel cross-task few-shot 2D gaze estimation approach, aiming to adapt a pre-trained 3D gaze estimation network for 2D gaze prediction on unseen devices using only a few training images. This task is highly challenging due to the domain gap between 3D and 2D gaze, unknown screen poses, and limited training data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that bridges the gap between 3D and 2D gaze. Our framework contains a physics-based differentiable projection module with learnable parameters to model screen poses and project 3D gaze into 2D gaze. The framework is fully differentiable and can integrate into existing 3D gaze networks without modifying their original architecture. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic pseudo-labelling strategy for flipped images, which is particularly challenging for 2D labels due to unknown screen poses. To overcome this, we reverse the projection process by converting 2D labels to 3D space, where flipping is performed. Notably, this 3D space is not aligned with the camera coordinate system, so we learn a dynamic transformation matrix to compensate for this misalignment. We evaluate our method on MPIIGaze, EVE, and GazeCapture datasets, collected respectively on laptops, desktop computers, and mobile devices. The superior performance highlights the effectiveness of our approach, and demonstrates its strong potential for real-world applications. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.04074v2) | N/A |
| StdGEN: Semantic-Decomposed 3D Character Generation from Single Images | Yuze He, Yanning Zhou, Wang Zhao, Zhongkai Wu, Kaiwen Xiao, Wei Yang, Yong-Jin Liu, Xiao Han | We present StdGEN, an innovative pipeline for generating semantically decomposed high-quality 3D characters from single images, enabling broad applications in virtual reality, gaming, and filmmaking, etc. Unlike previous methods which struggle with limited decomposability, unsatisfactory quality, and long optimization times, StdGEN features decomposability, effectiveness and efficiency; i.e., it generates intricately detailed 3D characters with separated semantic components such as the body, clothes, and hair, in three minutes. At the core of StdGEN is our proposed Semantic-aware Large Reconstruction Model (S-LRM), a transformer-based generalizable model that jointly reconstructs geometry, color and semantics from multi-view images in a feed-forward manner. A differentiable multi-layer semantic surface extraction scheme is introduced to acquire meshes from hybrid implicit fields reconstructed by our S-LRM. Additionally, a specialized efficient multi-view diffusion model and an iterative multi-layer surface refinement module are integrated into the pipeline to facilitate high-quality, decomposable 3D character generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance in 3D anime character generation, surpassing existing baselines by a significant margin in geometry, texture and decomposability. StdGEN offers ready-to-use semantic-decomposed 3D characters and enables flexible customization for a wide range of applications.

| Unveil Inversion and Invariance in Flow Transformer for Versatile Image Editing | Pengcheng Xu, Boyuan Jiang, Xiaobin Hu, Donghao Luo, Qingdong He, Jiangning Zhang, Chengjie Wang, Yunsheng Wu, Charles Ling, Boyu Wang | Leveraging the large generative prior of the flow transformer for tuning-free image editing requires authentic inversion to project the image into the model's domain and a flexible invariance control mechanism to preserve non-target contents. However, the prevailing diffusion inversion performs deficiently in flow-based models, and the invariance control cannot reconcile diverse rigid and non-rigid editing tasks. To address these, we systematically analyze the \textbf{inversion and invariance} control based on the flow transformer. Specifically, we unveil that the Euler inversion shares a similar structure to DDIM yet is more susceptible to the approximation error. Thus, we propose a two-stage inversion to first refine the velocity estimation and then compensate for the leftover error, which pivots closely to the model prior and benefits editing. Meanwhile, we propose the invariance control that manipulates the text features within the adaptive layer normalization, connecting the changes in the text prompt to image semantics. This mechanism can simultaneously preserve the non-target contents while allowing rigid and non-rigid manipulation, enabling a wide range of editing types such as visual text, quantity, facial expression, etc. Experiments on versatile scenarios validate that our framework achieves flexible and accurate editing, unlocking the potential of the flow transformer for versatile image editing. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.15843v3) | [https://pengchengpcx.github.io/EditFT](https://pengchengpcx.github.io/EditFT) |
| Taming Teacher Forcing for Masked Autoregressive Video Generation | Deyu Zhou, Quan Sun, Yuang Peng, Kun Yan, Runpei Dong, Duomin Wang, Zheng Ge, Nan Duan, Xiangyu Zhang, Lionel M. Ni, Heung-Yeung Shum | We introduce MAGI, a hybrid video generation framework that combines masked modeling for intra-frame generation with causal modeling for next-frame generation. Our key innovation, Complete Teacher Forcing (CTF), conditions masked frames on complete observation frames rather than masked ones (namely Masked Teacher Forcing, MTF), enabling a smooth transition from token-level (patch-level) to frame-level autoregressive generation. CTF significantly outperforms MTF, achieving a +23% improvement in FVD scores on first-frame conditioned video prediction. To address issues like exposure bias, we employ targeted training strategies, setting a new benchmark in autoregressive video generation. Experiments show that MAGI can generate long, coherent video sequences exceeding 100 frames, even when trained on as few as 16 frames, highlighting its potential for scalable, high-quality video generation. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12389v1) | N/A |
| Parallelized Autoregressive Visual Generation | Yuqing Wang, Shuhuai Ren, Zhijie Lin, Yujin Han, Haoyuan Guo, Zhenheng Yang, Difan Zou, Jiashi Feng, Xihui Liu | Autoregressive models have emerged as a powerful approach for visual generation but suffer from slow inference speed due to their sequential token-by-token prediction process. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach for parallelized autoregressive visual generation that improves generation efficiency while preserving the advantages of autoregressive modeling. Our key insight is that parallel generation depends on visual token dependencies-tokens with weak dependencies can be generated in parallel, while strongly dependent adjacent tokens are difficult to generate together, as their independent sampling may lead to inconsistencies. Based on this observation, we develop a parallel generation strategy that generates distant tokens with weak dependencies in parallel while maintaining sequential generation for strongly dependent local tokens. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated into standard autoregressive models without modifying the architecture or tokenizer. Experiments on ImageNet and UCF-101 demonstrate that our method achieves a 3.6x speedup with comparable quality and up to 9.5x speedup with minimal quality degradation across both image and video generation tasks. We hope this work will inspire future research in efficient visual generation and unified autoregressive modeling.

| Robust Message Embedding via Attention Flow-Based Steganography | Huayuan Ye, Shenzhuo Zhang, Shiqi Jiang, Jing Liao, Shuhang Gu, Dejun Zheng, Changbo Wang, Chenhui Li | Image steganography can hide information in a host image and obtain a stego image that is perceptually indistinguishable from the original one. This technique has tremendous potential in scenarios like copyright protection, information retrospection, etc. Some previous studies have proposed to enhance the robustness of the methods against image disturbances to increase their applicability. However, they generally cannot achieve a satisfying balance between the steganography quality and robustness. Instead of image-in-image steganography, we focus on the issue of message-in-image embedding that is robust to various real-world image distortions. This task aims to embed information into a natural image and the decoding result is required to be completely accurate, which increases the difficulty of data concealing and revealing. Inspired by the recent developments in transformer-based vision models, we discover that the tokenized representation of image is naturally suitable for steganography task. In this paper, we propose a novel message embedding framework, called Robust Message Steganography (RMSteg), which is competent to hide message via QR Code in a host image based on an normalizing flow-based model. The stego image derived by our method has imperceptible changes and the encoded message can be accurately restored even if the image is printed out and photoed. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that integrates the advantages of transformer models into normalizing flow. Our experiment result shows that RMSteg has great potential in robust and high-quality message embedding. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.16414v2) | [https://github.com/zxing/zxing](https://github.com/zxing/zxing) |
| EventGPT: Event Stream Understanding with Multimodal Large Language Models | Shaoyu Liu, Jianing Li, Guanghui Zhao, Yunjian Zhang, Xin Meng, Fei Richard Yu, Xiangyang Ji, Ming Li | Event cameras record visual information as asynchronous pixel change streams, excelling at scene perception under unsatisfactory lighting or high-dynamic conditions. Existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) concentrate on natural RGB images, failing in scenarios where event data fits better. In this paper, we introduce EventGPT, the first MLLM for event stream understanding, to the best of our knowledge, marking a pioneering attempt to integrate large language models (LLMs) with event stream comprehension. To mitigate the huge domain gaps, we develop a three-stage optimization paradigm to gradually equip a pre-trained LLM with the capability of understanding event-based scenes. Our EventGPT comprises an event encoder, followed by a spatio-temporal aggregator, a linear projector, an event-language adapter, and an LLM. Firstly, RGB image-text pairs generated by GPT are leveraged to warm up the linear projector, referring to LLaVA, as the gap between natural image and language modalities is relatively smaller. Secondly, we construct a synthetic yet large dataset, N-ImageNet-Chat, consisting of event frames and corresponding texts to enable the use of the spatio-temporal aggregator and to train the event-language adapter, thereby aligning event features more closely with the language space. Finally, we gather an instruction dataset, Event-Chat, which contains extensive real-world data to fine-tune the entire model, further enhancing its generalization ability. We construct a comprehensive benchmark, and experiments show that EventGPT surpasses previous state-of-the-art MLLMs in generation quality, descriptive accuracy, and reasoning capability. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.00832v1) | N/A |
| GASP: Gaussian Avatars with Synthetic Priors | Jack Saunders, Charlie Hewitt, Yanan Jian, Marek Kowalski, Tadas Baltrusaitis, Yiye Chen, Darren Cosker, Virginia Estellers, Nicholas Gyde, Vinay P. Namboodiri, Benjamin E Lundell | Gaussian Splatting has changed the game for real-time photo-realistic rendering. One of the most popular applications of Gaussian Splatting is to create animatable avatars, known as Gaussian Avatars. Recent works have pushed the boundaries of quality and rendering efficiency but suffer from two main limitations. Either they require expensive multi-camera rigs to produce avatars with free-view rendering, or they can be trained with a single camera but only rendered at high quality from this fixed viewpoint. An ideal model would be trained using a short monocular video or image from available hardware, such as a webcam, and rendered from any view. To this end, we propose GASP: Gaussian Avatars with Synthetic Priors. To overcome the limitations of existing datasets, we exploit the pixel-perfect nature of synthetic data to train a Gaussian Avatar prior. By fitting this prior model to a single photo or video and fine-tuning it, we get a high-quality Gaussian Avatar, which supports 360$^\circ$ rendering. Our prior is only required for fitting, not inference, enabling real-time application. Through our method, we obtain high-quality, animatable Avatars from limited data which can be animated and rendered at 70fps on commercial hardware.

| CustAny: Customizing Anything from A Single Example | Lingjie Kong, Kai Wu, Xiaobin Hu, Wenhui Han, Jinlong Peng, Chengming Xu, Donghao Luo, Mengtian Li, Jiangning Zhang, Chengjie Wang, Yanwei Fu | Recent advances in diffusion-based text-to-image models have simplified creating high-fidelity images, but preserving the identity (ID) of specific elements, like a personal dog, is still challenging. Object customization, using reference images and textual descriptions, is key to addressing this issue. Current object customization methods are either object-specific, requiring extensive fine-tuning, or object-agnostic, offering zero-shot customization but limited to specialized domains. The primary issue of promoting zero-shot object customization from specific domains to the general domain is to establish a large-scale general ID dataset for model pre-training, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose a novel pipeline to construct a large dataset of general objects and build the Multi-Category ID-Consistent (MC-IDC) dataset, featuring 315k text-image samples across 10k categories. With the help of MC-IDC, we introduce Customizing Anything (CustAny), a zero-shot framework that maintains ID fidelity and supports flexible text editing for general objects. CustAny features three key components: a general ID extraction module, a dual-level ID injection module, and an ID-aware decoupling module, allowing it to customize any object from a single reference image and text prompt. Experiments demonstrate that CustAny outperforms existing methods in both general object customization and specialized domains like human customization and virtual try-on. Our contributions include a large-scale dataset, the CustAny framework and novel ID processing to advance this field. Code and dataset will be released soon in https://github.com/LingjieKong-fdu/CustAny. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.11643v4) | N/A |
| ECVC: Exploiting Non-Local Correlations in Multiple Frames for Contextual Video Compression | Wei Jiang, Junru Li, Kai Zhang, Li Zhang | In Learned Video Compression (LVC), improving inter prediction, such as enhancing temporal context mining and mitigating accumulated errors, is crucial for boosting rate-distortion performance. Existing LVCs mainly focus on mining the temporal movements while neglecting non-local correlations among frames. Additionally, current contextual video compression models use a single reference frame, which is insufficient for handling complex movements. To address these issues, we propose leveraging non-local correlations across multiple frames to enhance temporal priors, significantly boosting rate-distortion performance. To mitigate error accumulation, we introduce a partial cascaded fine-tuning strategy that supports fine-tuning on full-length sequences with constrained computational resources. This method reduces the train-test mismatch in sequence lengths and significantly decreases accumulated errors. Based on the proposed techniques, we present a video compression scheme ECVC. Experiments demonstrate that our ECVC achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing $10.5\%$ and $11.5\%$ more bit-rates than previous SOTA method DCVC-FM over VTM-13.2 low delay B (LDB) under the intra period (IP) of $32$ and $-1$, respectively.

Wittig, Kevin Langergraber, Klaus Zuberbühler, Lukas Boesch, Thomas Schmid, Mimi Arandjelovic, Hjalmar Kühl, Tilo Burghardt | Computer vision analysis of camera trap video footage is essential for wildlife conservation, as captured behaviours offer some of the earliest indicators of changes in population health. Recently, several high-impact animal behaviour datasets and methods have been introduced to encourage their use; however, the role of behaviour-correlated background information and its significant effect on out-of-distribution generalisation remain unexplored. In response, we present the PanAf-FGBG dataset, featuring 20 hours of wild chimpanzee behaviours, recorded at over 350 individual camera locations. Uniquely, it pairs every video with a chimpanzee (referred to as a foreground video) with a corresponding background video (with no chimpanzee) from the same camera location. We present two views of the dataset: one with overlapping camera locations and one with disjoint locations. This setup enables, for the first time, direct evaluation of in-distribution and out-of-distribution conditions, and for the impact of backgrounds on behaviour recognition models to be quantified. All clips come with rich behavioural annotations and metadata including unique camera IDs and detailed textual scene descriptions. Additionally, we establish several baselines and present a highly effective latent-space normalisation technique that boosts out-of-distribution performance by +5.42% mAP for convolutional and +3.75% mAP for transformer-based models. Finally, we provide an in-depth analysis on the role of backgrounds in out-of-distribution behaviour recognition, including the so far unexplored impact of background durations (i.e., the count of background frames within foreground videos). | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.21201v2) | N/A |

However, generating patient or slide level embeddings remains challenging. Existing approaches for slide representation learning extend the principles of SSL from patch level learning to entire slides by aligning different augmentations of the slide or by utilizing multimodal data. By integrating tile embeddings from multiple FMs, we propose a new single modality SSL method in feature space that generates useful slide representations. Our contrastive pretraining strategy, called COBRA, employs multiple FMs and an architecture based on Mamba-2. COBRA exceeds performance of state-of-the-art slide encoders on four different public Clinical Protemic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) cohorts on average by at least +4.5% AUC, despite only being pretrained on 3048 WSIs from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Additionally, COBRA is readily compatible at inference time with previously unseen feature extractors.

| MobilePortrait: Real-Time One-Shot Neural Head Avatars on Mobile Devices | Jianwen Jiang, Gaojie Lin, Zhengkun Rong, Chao Liang, Yongming Zhu, Jiaqi Yang, Tianyun Zhong | Existing neural head avatars methods have achieved significant progress in the image quality and motion range of portrait animation. However, these methods neglect the computational overhead, and to the best of our knowledge, none is designed to run on mobile devices. This paper presents MobilePortrait, a lightweight one-shot neural head avatars method that reduces learning complexity by integrating external knowledge into both the motion modeling and image synthesis, enabling real-time inference on mobile devices. Specifically, we introduce a mixed representation of explicit and implicit keypoints for precise motion modeling and precomputed visual features for enhanced foreground and background synthesis. With these two key designs and using simple U-Nets as backbones, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with less than one-tenth the computational demand. It has been validated to reach speeds of over 100 FPS on mobile devices and support both video and audio-driven inputs. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05712v1) | N/A |
| SOLAMI: Social Vision-Language-Action Modeling for Immersive Interaction with 3D Autonomous Characters | Jianping Jiang, Weiye Xiao, Zhengyu Lin, Huaizhong Zhang, Tianxiang Ren, Yang Gao, Zhiqian Lin, Zhongang Cai, Lei Yang, Ziwei Liu | Human beings are social animals. How to equip 3D autonomous characters with similar social intelligence that can perceive, understand and interact with humans remains an open yet foundamental problem. In this paper, we introduce SOLAMI, the first end-to-end Social vision-Language-Action (VLA) Modeling framework for Immersive interaction with 3D autonomous characters. Specifically, SOLAMI builds 3D autonomous characters from three aspects: (1) Social VLA Architecture: We propose a unified social VLA framework to generate multimodal response (speech and motion) based on the user's multimodal input to drive the character for social interaction. (2) Interactive Multimodal Data: We present SynMSI, a synthetic multimodal social interaction dataset generated by an automatic pipeline using only existing motion datasets to address the issue of data scarcity. (3) Immersive VR Interface: We develop a VR interface that enables users to immersively interact with these characters driven by various architectures. Extensive quantitative experiments and user studies demonstrate that our framework leads to more precise and natural character responses (in both speech and motion) that align with user expectations with lower latency. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.00174v1) | N/A |
| Temporally Consistent Object-Centric Learning by Contrasting Slots | Anna Manasyan, Maximilian Seitzer, Filip Radovic, Georg Martius, Andrii Zadaianchuk | Unsupervised object-centric learning from videos is a promising approach to extract structured representations from large, unlabeled collections of videos. To support downstream tasks like autonomous control, these representations must be both compositional and temporally consistent. Existing approaches based on recurrent processing often lack long-term stability across frames because their training objective does not enforce temporal consistency. In this work, we introduce a novel object-level temporal contrastive loss for video object-centric models that explicitly promotes temporal consistency. Our method significantly improves the temporal consistency of the learned object-centric representations, yielding more reliable video decompositions that facilitate challenging downstream tasks such as unsupervised object dynamics prediction. Furthermore, the inductive bias added by our loss strongly improves object discovery, leading to state-of-the-art results on both synthetic and real-world datasets, outperforming even weakly-supervised methods that leverage motion masks as additional cues. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14295v1) | [https://github.com/pairlab/SlotFormer](https://github.com/pairlab/SlotFormer) |
| Towards Unbiased and Robust Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph Generation and Anticipation | Rohith Peddi, Saurabh, Ayush Abhay Shrivastava, Parag Singla, Vibhav Gogate | Spatio-Temporal Scene Graphs (STSGs) provide a concise and expressive representation of dynamic scenes by modelling objects and their evolving relationships over time. However, real-world visual relationships often exhibit a long-tailed distribution, causing existing methods for tasks like Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) and Scene Graph Anticipation (SGA) to produce biased scene graphs. To this end, we propose ImparTail, a novel training framework that leverages curriculum learning and loss masking to mitigate bias in the generation and anticipation of spatio-temporal scene graphs. Our approach gradually decreases the dominance of the head relationship classes during training and focuses more on tail classes, leading to more balanced training. Furthermore, we introduce two new tasks, Robust Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph Generation and Robust Scene Graph Anticipation, designed to evaluate the robustness of STSG models against distribution shifts. Extensive experiments on the Action Genome dataset demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances the unbiased performance and robustness of STSG models compared to existing methods. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.13059v1) | N/A |
| UIBDiffusion: Universal Imperceptible Backdoor Attack for Diffusion Models | Yuning Han, Bingyin Zhao, Rui Chu, Feng Luo, Biplab Sikdar, Yingjie Lao | Recent studies show that diffusion models (DMs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks impose unconcealed triggers (e.g., a gray box and eyeglasses) that contain evident patterns, rendering remarkable attack effects yet easy detection upon human inspection and defensive algorithms. While it is possible to improve stealthiness by reducing the strength of the backdoor, doing so can significantly compromise its generality and effectiveness. In this paper, we propose UIBDiffusion, the universal imperceptible backdoor attack for diffusion models, which allows us to achieve superior attack and generation performance while evading state-of-the-art defenses. We propose a novel trigger generation approach based on universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) and reveal that such perturbations, which are initially devised for fooling pre-trained discriminative models, can be adapted as potent imperceptible backdoor triggers for DMs. We evaluate UIBDiffusion on multiple types of DMs with different kinds of samplers across various datasets and targets. Experimental results demonstrate that UIBDiffusion brings three advantages: 1) Universality, the imperceptible trigger is universal (i.e., image and model agnostic) where a single trigger is effective to any images and all diffusion models with different samplers; 2) Utility, it achieves comparable generation quality (e.g., FID) and even better attack success rate (i.e., ASR) at low poison rates compared to the prior works; and 3) Undetectability, UIBDiffusion is plausible to human perception and can bypass Elijah and TERD, the SOTA defenses against backdoors for DMs. We will release our backdoor triggers and code. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11441v3) | N/A |
| UVGS: Reimagining Unstructured 3D Gaussian Splatting using UV Mapping | Aashish Rai, Dilin Wang, Mihir Jain, Nikolaos Sarafianos, Kefan Chen, Srinath Sridhar, Aayush Prakash | 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated superior quality in modeling 3D objects and scenes. However, generating 3DGS remains challenging due to their discrete, unstructured, and permutation-invariant nature. In this work, we present a simple yet effective method to overcome these challenges. We utilize spherical mapping to transform 3DGS into a structured 2D representation, termed UVGS. UVGS can be viewed as multi-channel images, with feature dimensions as a concatenation of Gaussian attributes such as position, scale, color, opacity, and rotation. We further find that these heterogeneous features can be compressed into a lower-dimensional (e.g., 3-channel) shared feature space using a carefully designed multi-branch network. The compressed UVGS can be treated as typical RGB images. Remarkably, we discover that typical VAEs trained with latent diffusion models can directly generalize to this new representation without additional training. Our novel representation makes it effortless to leverage foundational 2D models, such as diffusion models, to directly model 3DGS. Additionally, one can simply increase the 2D UV resolution to accommodate more Gaussians, making UVGS a scalable solution compared to typical 3D backbones. This approach immediately unlocks various novel generation applications of 3DGS by inherently utilizing the already developed superior 2D generation capabilities. In our experiments, we demonstrate various unconditional, conditional generation, and inpainting applications of 3DGS based on diffusion models, which were previously non-trivial. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01846v2) | [https://aashishrai3799.github.io/uvgs](https://aashishrai3799.github.io/uvgs) |
| Floxels: Fast Unsupervised Voxel Based Scene Flow Estimation | David T. Hoffmann, Syed Haseeb Raza, Hanqiu Jiang, Denis Tananaev, Steffen Klingenhoefer, Martin Meinke | Scene flow estimation is a foundational task for many robotic applications, including robust dynamic object detection, automatic labeling, and sensor synchronization. Two types of approaches to the problem have evolved: 1) Supervised and 2) optimization-based methods. Supervised methods are fast during inference and achieve high-quality results, however, they are limited by the need for large amounts of labeled training data and are susceptible to domain gaps. In contrast, unsupervised test-time optimization methods do not face the problem of domain gaps but usually suffer from substantial runtime, exhibit artifacts, or fail to converge to the right solution. In this work, we mitigate several limitations of existing optimization-based methods. To this end, we 1) introduce a simple voxel grid-based model that improves over the standard MLP-based formulation in multiple dimensions and 2) introduce a new multiframe loss formulation. 3) We combine both contributions in our new method, termed Floxels. On the Argoverse 2 benchmark, Floxels is surpassed only by EulerFlow among unsupervised methods while achieving comparable performance at a fraction of the computational cost. Floxels achieves a massive speedup of more than ~60 - 140x over EulerFlow, reducing the runtime from a day to 10 minutes per sequence. Over the faster but low-quality baseline, NSFP, Floxels achieves a speedup of ~14x. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04718v1) | [https://github.com/Lilac-Lee/Neural_Scene_](https://github.com/Lilac-Lee/Neural_Scene_), [https://github.com/Lilac-Lee/FastNSF](https://github.com/Lilac-Lee/FastNSF) |
| VideoGuide: Improving Video Diffusion Models without Training Through a Teacher's Guide | Dohun Lee, Bryan S Kim, Geon Yeong Park, Jong Chul Ye | Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have revolutionized visual content creation, but extending these capabilities to text-to-video (T2V) generation remains a challenge, particularly in preserving temporal consistency. Existing methods that aim to improve consistency often cause trade-offs such as reduced imaging quality and impractical computational time. To address these issues we introduce VideoGuide, a novel framework that enhances the temporal consistency of pretrained T2V models without the need for additional training or fine-tuning. Instead, VideoGuide leverages any pretrained video diffusion model (VDM) or itself as a guide during the early stages of inference, improving temporal quality by interpolating the guiding model's denoised samples into the sampling model's denoising process. The proposed method brings about significant improvement in temporal consistency and image fidelity, providing a cost-effective and practical solution that synergizes the strengths of various video diffusion models. Furthermore, we demonstrate prior distillation, revealing that base models can achieve enhanced text coherence by utilizing the superior data prior of the guiding model through the proposed method.

| Wonderland: Navigating 3D Scenes from a Single Image | Hanwen Liang, Junli Cao, Vidit Goel, Guocheng Qian, Sergei Korolev, Demetri Terzopoulos, Konstantinos N. Plataniotis, Sergey Tulyakov, Jian Ren | This paper addresses a challenging question: How can we efficiently create high-quality, wide-scope 3D scenes from a single arbitrary image? Existing methods face several constraints, such as requiring multi-view data, time-consuming per-scene optimization, low visual quality in backgrounds, and distorted reconstructions in unseen areas. We propose a novel pipeline to overcome these limitations. Specifically, we introduce a large-scale reconstruction model that uses latents from a video diffusion model to predict 3D Gaussian Splattings for the scenes in a feed-forward manner. The video diffusion model is designed to create videos precisely following specified camera trajectories, allowing it to generate compressed video latents that contain multi-view information while maintaining 3D consistency. We train the 3D reconstruction model to operate on the video latent space with a progressive training strategy, enabling the efficient generation of high-quality, wide-scope, and generic 3D scenes. Extensive evaluations across various datasets demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms existing methods for single-view 3D scene generation, particularly with out-of-domain images. For the first time, we demonstrate that a 3D reconstruction model can be effectively built upon the latent space of a diffusion model to realize efficient 3D scene generation. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12091v1) | [https://github.com/xdit-project/xDiT](https://github.com/xdit-project/xDiT), [https://snap-research.github.io/wonderland](https://snap-research.github.io/wonderland) |
| Emphasizing Discriminative Features for Dataset Distillation in Complex Scenarios | Kai Wang, Zekai Li, Zhi-Qi Cheng, Samir Khaki, Ahmad Sajedi, Ramakrishna Vedantam, Konstantinos N Plataniotis, Alexander Hauptmann, Yang You | Dataset distillation has demonstrated strong performance on simple datasets like CIFAR, MNIST, and TinyImageNet but struggles to achieve similar results in more complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose EDF (emphasizes the discriminative features), a dataset distillation method that enhances key discriminative regions in synthetic images using Grad-CAM activation maps. Our approach is inspired by a key observation: in simple datasets, high-activation areas typically occupy most of the image, whereas in complex scenarios, the size of these areas is much smaller. Unlike previous methods that treat all pixels equally when synthesizing images, EDF uses Grad-CAM activation maps to enhance high-activation areas. From a supervision perspective, we downplay supervision signals that have lower losses, as they contain common patterns. Additionally, to help the DD community better explore complex scenarios, we build the Complex Dataset Distillation (Comp-DD) benchmark by meticulously selecting sixteen subsets, eight easy and eight hard, from ImageNet-1K. In particular, EDF consistently outperforms SOTA results in complex scenarios, such as ImageNet-1K subsets. Hopefully, more researchers will be inspired and encouraged to improve the practicality and efficacy of DD.

| DyMO: Training-Free Diffusion Model Alignment with Dynamic Multi-Objective Scheduling | Xin Xie, Dong Gong | Text-to-image diffusion model alignment is critical for improving the alignment between the generated images and human preferences. While training-based methods are constrained by high computational costs and dataset requirements, training-free alignment methods remain underexplored and are often limited by inaccurate guidance. We propose a plug-and-play training-free alignment method, DyMO, for aligning the generated images and human preferences during inference. Apart from text-aware human preference scores, we introduce a semantic alignment objective for enhancing the semantic alignment in the early stages of diffusion, relying on the fact that the attention maps are effective reflections of the semantics in noisy images. We propose dynamic scheduling of multiple objectives and intermediate recurrent steps to reflect the requirements at different steps. Experiments with diverse pre-trained diffusion models and metrics demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.00759v2) | N/A |
| Completion as Enhancement: A Degradation-Aware Selective Image Guided Network for Depth Completion | Zhiqiang Yan, Zhengxue Wang, Kun Wang, Jun Li, Jian Yang | In this paper, we introduce the Selective Image Guided Network (SigNet), a novel degradation-aware framework that transforms depth completion into depth enhancement for the first time. Moving beyond direct completion using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), SigNet initially densifies sparse depth data through non-CNN densification tools to obtain coarse yet dense depth. This approach eliminates the mismatch and ambiguity caused by direct convolution over irregularly sampled sparse data. Subsequently, SigNet redefines completion as enhancement, establishing a self-supervised degradation bridge between the coarse depth and the targeted dense depth for effective RGB-D fusion. To achieve this, SigNet leverages the implicit degradation to adaptively select high-frequency components (e.g., edges) of RGB data to compensate for the coarse depth. This degradation is further integrated into a multi-modal conditional Mamba, dynamically generating the state parameters to enable efficient global high-frequency information interaction. We conduct extensive experiments on the NYUv2, DIML, SUN RGBD, and TOFDC datasets, demonstrating the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of SigNet. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19225v2) | N/A |
| DepthCues: Evaluating Monocular Depth Perception in Large Vision Models | Duolikun Danier, Mehmet Aygün, Changjian Li, Hakan Bilen, Oisin Mac Aodha | Large-scale pre-trained vision models are becoming increasingly prevalent, offering expressive and generalizable visual representations that benefit various downstream tasks. Recent studies on the emergent properties of these models have revealed their high-level geometric understanding, in particular in the context of depth perception. However, it remains unclear how depth perception arises in these models without explicit depth supervision provided during pre-training. To investigate this, we examine whether the monocular depth cues, similar to those used by the human visual system, emerge in these models. We introduce a new benchmark, DepthCues, designed to evaluate depth cue understanding, and present findings across 20 diverse and representative pre-trained vision models. Our analysis shows that human-like depth cues emerge in more recent larger models. We also explore enhancing depth perception in large vision models by fine-tuning on DepthCues, and find that even without dense depth supervision, this improves depth estimation. To support further research, our benchmark and evaluation code will be made publicly available for studying depth perception in vision models. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.17385v2) | [https://github.com/facebookresearch/dino](https://github.com/facebookresearch/dino), [https://danier97.github.io/depthcues](https://danier97.github.io/depthcues) |
| FlashGS: Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting for Large-scale and High-resolution Rendering | Guofeng Feng, Siyan Chen, Rong Fu, Zimu Liao, Yi Wang, Tao Liu, Zhilin Pei, Hengjie Li, Xingcheng Zhang, Bo Dai | This work introduces FlashGS, an open-source CUDA Python library, designed to facilitate the efficient differentiable rasterization of 3D Gaussian Splatting through algorithmic and kernel-level optimizations. FlashGS is developed based on the observations from a comprehensive analysis of the rendering process to enhance computational efficiency and bring the technique to wide adoption. The paper includes a suite of optimization strategies, encompassing redundancy elimination, efficient pipelining, refined control and scheduling mechanisms, and memory access optimizations, all of which are meticulously integrated to amplify the performance of the rasterization process. An extensive evaluation of FlashGS' performance has been conducted across a diverse spectrum of synthetic and real-world large-scale scenes, encompassing a variety of image resolutions. The empirical findings demonstrate that FlashGS consistently achieves an average 4x acceleration over mobile consumer GPUs, coupled with reduced memory consumption. These results underscore the superior performance and resource optimization capabilities of FlashGS, positioning it as a formidable tool in the domain of 3D rendering. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07967v2) | [https://github.com/InternLandMark/FlashGS](https://github.com/InternLandMark/FlashGS) |
| DKDM: Data-Free Knowledge Distillation for Diffusion Models with Any Architecture | Qianlong Xiang, Miao Zhang, Yuzhang Shang, Jianlong Wu, Yan Yan, Liqiang Nie | Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated exceptional generative capabilities across various domains, including image, video, and so on. A key factor contributing to their effectiveness is the high quantity and quality of data used during training. However, mainstream DMs now consume increasingly large amounts of data. For example, training a Stable Diffusion model requires billions of image-text pairs. This enormous data requirement poses significant challenges for training large DMs due to high data acquisition costs and storage expenses. To alleviate this data burden, we propose a novel scenario: using existing DMs as data sources to train new DMs with any architecture. We refer to this scenario as Data-Free Knowledge Distillation for Diffusion Models (DKDM), where the generative ability of DMs is transferred to new ones in a data-free manner. To tackle this challenge, we make two main contributions. First, we introduce a DKDM objective that enables the training of new DMs via distillation, without requiring access to the data. Second, we develop a dynamic iterative distillation method that efficiently extracts time-domain knowledge from existing DMs, enabling direct retrieval of training data without the need for a prolonged generative process. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore this scenario. Experimental results demonstrate that our data-free approach not only achieves competitive generative performance but also, in some instances, outperforms models trained with the entire dataset. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03550v2) | [https://github.com/qianlong0502/DKDM](https://github.com/qianlong0502/DKDM) |
| Spatiotemporal Skip Guidance for Enhanced Video Diffusion Sampling | Junha Hyung, Kinam Kim, Susung Hong, Min-Jung Kim, Jaegul Choo | Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful tool for generating high-quality images, videos, and 3D content. While sampling guidance techniques like CFG improve quality, they reduce diversity and motion. Autoguidance mitigates these issues but demands extra weak model training, limiting its practicality for large-scale models. In this work, we introduce Spatiotemporal Skip Guidance (STG), a simple training-free sampling guidance method for enhancing transformer-based video diffusion models. STG employs an implicit weak model via self-perturbation, avoiding the need for external models or additional training. By selectively skipping spatiotemporal layers, STG produces an aligned, degraded version of the original model to boost sample quality without compromising diversity or dynamic degree. Our contributions include: (1) introducing STG as an efficient, high-performing guidance technique for video diffusion models, (2) eliminating the need for auxiliary models by simulating a weak model through layer skipping, and (3) ensuring quality-enhanced guidance without compromising sample diversity or dynamics unlike CFG.

| Thinking in Space: How Multimodal Large Language Models See, Remember, and Recall Spaces | Jihan Yang, Shusheng Yang, Anjali W. Gupta, Rilyn Han, Li Fei-Fei, Saining Xie | Humans possess the visual-spatial intelligence to remember spaces from sequential visual observations. However, can Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) trained on million-scale video datasets also ``think in space'' from videos? We present a novel video-based visual-spatial intelligence benchmark (VSI-Bench) of over 5,000 question-answer pairs, and find that MLLMs exhibit competitive - though subhuman - visual-spatial intelligence. We probe models to express how they think in space both linguistically and visually and find that while spatial reasoning capabilities remain the primary bottleneck for MLLMs to reach higher benchmark performance, local world models and spatial awareness do emerge within these models. Notably, prevailing linguistic reasoning techniques (e.g., chain-of-thought, self-consistency, tree-of-thoughts) fail to improve performance, whereas explicitly generating cognitive maps during question-answering enhances MLLMs' spatial distance ability. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.14171v1) | N/A |
| Exploring Scene Affinity for Semi-Supervised LiDAR Semantic Segmentation | Chuandong Liu, Xingxing Weng, Shuguo Jiang, Pengcheng Li, Lei Yu, Gui-Song Xia | This paper explores scene affinity (AIScene), namely intra-scene consistency and inter-scene correlation, for semi-supervised LiDAR semantic segmentation in driving scenes. Adopting teacher-student training, AIScene employs a teacher network to generate pseudo-labeled scenes from unlabeled data, which then supervise the student network's learning. Unlike most methods that include all points in pseudo-labeled scenes for forward propagation but only pseudo-labeled points for backpropagation, AIScene removes points without pseudo-labels, ensuring consistency in both forward and backward propagation within the scene. This simple point erasure strategy effectively prevents unsupervised, semantically ambiguous points (excluded in backpropagation) from affecting the learning of pseudo-labeled points. Moreover, AIScene incorporates patch-based data augmentation, mixing multiple scenes at both scene and instance levels. Compared to existing augmentation techniques that typically perform scene-level mixing between two scenes, our method enhances the semantic diversity of labeled (or pseudo-labeled) scenes, thereby improving the semi-supervised performance of segmentation models. Experiments show that AIScene outperforms previous methods on two popular benchmarks across four settings, achieving notable improvements of 1.9% and 5.3% in the most challenging 1\% labeled data. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11280v2) | N/A |
| Cubify Anything: Scaling Indoor 3D Object Detection | Justin Lazarow, David Griffiths, Gefen Kohavi, Francisco Crespo, Afshin Dehghan | We consider indoor 3D object detection with respect to a single RGB(-D) frame acquired from a commodity handheld device. We seek to significantly advance the status quo with respect to both data and modeling. First, we establish that existing datasets have significant limitations to scale, accuracy, and diversity of objects. As a result, we introduce the Cubify-Anything 1M (CA-1M) dataset, which exhaustively labels over 400K 3D objects on over 1K highly accurate laser-scanned scenes with near-perfect registration to over 3.5K handheld, egocentric captures. Next, we establish Cubify Transformer (CuTR), a fully Transformer 3D object detection baseline which rather than operating in 3D on point or voxel-based representations, predicts 3D boxes directly from 2D features derived from RGB(-D) inputs. While this approach lacks any 3D inductive biases, we show that paired with CA-1M, CuTR outperforms point-based methods - accurately recalling over 62% of objects in 3D, and is significantly more capable at handling noise and uncertainty present in commodity LiDAR-derived depth maps while also providing promising RGB only performance without architecture changes. Furthermore, by pre-training on CA-1M, CuTR can outperform point-based methods on a more diverse variant of SUN RGB-D - supporting the notion that while inductive biases in 3D are useful at the smaller sizes of existing datasets, they fail to scale to the data-rich regime of CA-1M. Overall, this dataset and baseline model provide strong evidence that we are moving towards models which can effectively Cubify Anything. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04458v1) | N/A |
| GoalFlow: Goal-Driven Flow Matching for Multimodal Trajectories Generation in End-to-End Autonomous Driving | Zebin Xing, Xingyu Zhang, Yang Hu, Bo Jiang, Tong He, Qian Zhang, Xiaoxiao Long, Wei Yin | We propose GoalFlow, an end-to-end autonomous driving method for generating high-quality multimodal trajectories. In autonomous driving scenarios, there is rarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused on modeling multimodal trajectory distributions. However, they suffer from trajectory selection complexity and reduced trajectory quality due to high trajectory divergence and inconsistencies between guidance and scene information. To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality, multimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by introducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that selects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on scene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative method, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a refined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates. Our experimental results, validated on the Navsim\cite{Dauner2024_navsim}, demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS of 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods. Compared with other diffusion-policy-based methods, our approach requires only a single denoising step to obtain excellent performance.

| SCSegamba: Lightweight Structure-Aware Vision Mamba for Crack Segmentation in Structures | Hui Liu, Chen Jia, Fan Shi, Xu Cheng, Shengyong Chen | Pixel-level segmentation of structural cracks across various scenarios remains a considerable challenge. Current methods encounter challenges in effectively modeling crack morphology and texture, facing challenges in balancing segmentation quality with low computational resource usage. To overcome these limitations, we propose a lightweight Structure-Aware Vision Mamba Network (SCSegamba), capable of generating high-quality pixel-level segmentation maps by leveraging both the morphological information and texture cues of crack pixels with minimal computational cost. Specifically, we developed a Structure-Aware Visual State Space module (SAVSS), which incorporates a lightweight Gated Bottleneck Convolution (GBC) and a Structure-Aware Scanning Strategy (SASS). The key insight of GBC lies in its effectiveness in modeling the morphological information of cracks, while the SASS enhances the perception of crack topology and texture by strengthening the continuity of semantic information between crack pixels. Experiments on crack benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving the highest performance with only 2.8M parameters. On the multi-scenario dataset, our method reached 0.8390 in F1 score and 0.8479 in mIoU.

| Towards Stable and Storage-efficient Dataset Distillation: Matching Convexified Trajectory | Wenliang Zhong, Haoyu Tang, Qinghai Zheng, Mingzhu Xu, Yupeng Hu, Liqiang Nie | The rapid evolution of deep learning and large language models has led to an exponential growth in the demand for training data, prompting the development of Dataset Distillation methods to address the challenges of managing large datasets. Among these, Matching Training Trajectories (MTT) has been a prominent approach, which replicates the training trajectory of an expert network on real data with a synthetic dataset. However, our investigation found that this method suffers from three significant limitations: 1. Instability of expert trajectory generated by Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD); 2. Low convergence speed of the distillation process; 3. High storage consumption of the expert trajectory. To address these issues, we offer a new perspective on understanding the essence of Dataset Distillation and MTT through a simple transformation of the objective function, and introduce a novel method called Matching Convexified Trajectory (MCT), which aims to provide better guidance for the student trajectory. MCT leverages insights from the linearized dynamics of Neural Tangent Kernel methods to create a convex combination of expert trajectories, guiding the student network to converge rapidly and stably. This trajectory is not only easier to store, but also enables a continuous sampling strategy during distillation, ensuring thorough learning and fitting of the entire expert trajectory. Comprehensive experiments across three public datasets validate the superiority of MCT over traditional MTT methods. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.19827v1) | N/A |
| Detecting Out-of-Distribution Through the Lens of Neural Collapse | Litian Liu, Yao Qin | Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for safe deployment; however, existing detectors exhibit generalization discrepancies and cost concerns. To address this, we propose a highly versatile and efficient OOD detector inspired by the trend of Neural Collapse on practical models, without requiring complete collapse. By analyzing this trend, we discover that features of in-distribution (ID) samples cluster closer to the weight vectors compared to features of OOD samples. Additionally, we reveal that ID features tend to expand in space to structure a simplex Equiangular Tight Framework, which explains the prevalent observation that ID features reside further from the origin than OOD features. Taking both insights from Neural Collapse into consideration, our OOD detector utilizes feature proximity to weight vectors and further complements this perspective by using feature norms to filter OOD samples. Extensive experiments on off-the-shelf models demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our OOD detector across diverse classification tasks and model architectures, mitigating generalization discrepancies and improving overall performance. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.01479v6) | [https://github.com/lukemelas/PyTorch-Pretrained-ViT](https://github.com/lukemelas/PyTorch-Pretrained-ViT) |
| CraftsMan: High-fidelity Mesh Generation with 3D Native Generation and Interactive Geometry Refiner | Weiyu Li, Jiarui Liu, Rui Chen, Yixun Liang, Xuelin Chen, Ping Tan, Xiaoxiao Long | We present a novel generative 3D modeling system, coined CraftsMan, which can generate high-fidelity 3D geometries with highly varied shapes, regular mesh topologies, and detailed surfaces, and, notably, allows for refining the geometry in an interactive manner. Despite the significant advancements in 3D generation, existing methods still struggle with lengthy optimization processes, irregular mesh topologies, noisy surfaces, and difficulties in accommodating user edits, consequently impeding their widespread adoption and implementation in 3D modeling software. Our work is inspired by the craftsman, who usually roughs out the holistic figure of the work first and elaborates the surface details subsequently. Specifically, we employ a 3D native diffusion model, which operates on latent space learned from latent set-based 3D representations, to generate coarse geometries with regular mesh topology in seconds. In particular, this process takes as input a text prompt or a reference image and leverages a powerful multi-view (MV) diffusion model to generate multiple views of the coarse geometry, which are fed into our MV-conditioned 3D diffusion model for generating the 3D geometry, significantly improving robustness and generalizability. Following that, a normal-based geometry refiner is used to significantly enhance the surface details. This refinement can be performed automatically, or interactively with user-supplied edits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves high efficacy in producing superior-quality 3D assets compared to existing methods.

| Flowing from Words to Pixels: A Framework for Cross-Modality Evolution | Qihao Liu, Xi Yin, Alan Yuille, Andrew Brown, Mannat Singh | Diffusion models, and their generalization, flow matching, have had a remarkable impact on the field of media generation. Here, the conventional approach is to learn the complex mapping from a simple source distribution of Gaussian noise to the target media distribution. For cross-modal tasks such as text-to-image generation, this same mapping from noise to image is learnt whilst including a conditioning mechanism in the model. One key and thus far relatively unexplored feature of flow matching is that, unlike Diffusion models, they are not constrained for the source distribution to be noise. Hence, in this paper, we propose a paradigm shift, and ask the question of whether we can instead train flow matching models to learn a direct mapping from the distribution of one modality to the distribution of another, thus obviating the need for both the noise distribution and conditioning mechanism. We present a general and simple framework, CrossFlow, for cross-modal flow matching. We show the importance of applying Variational Encoders to the input data, and introduce a method to enable Classifier-free guidance. Surprisingly, for text-to-image, CrossFlow with a vanilla transformer without cross attention slightly outperforms standard flow matching, and we show that it scales better with training steps and model size, while also allowing for interesting latent arithmetic which results in semantically meaningful edits in the output space. To demonstrate the generalizability of our approach, we also show that CrossFlow is on par with or outperforms the state-of-the-art for various cross-modal / intra-modal mapping tasks, viz. image captioning, depth estimation, and image super-resolution. We hope this paper contributes to accelerating progress in cross-modal media generation. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15213v1) | N/A |
| MERGE: Multi-faceted Hierarchical Graph-based GNN for Gene Expression Prediction from Whole Slide Histopathology Images | Aniruddha Ganguly, Debolina Chatterjee, Wentao Huang, Jie Zhang, Alisa Yurovsky, Travis Steele Johnson, Chao Chen | Recent advances in Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) pair histology images with spatially resolved gene expression profiles, enabling predictions of gene expression across different tissue locations based on image patches. This opens up new possibilities for enhancing whole slide image (WSI) prediction tasks with localized gene expression. However, existing methods fail to fully leverage the interactions between different tissue locations, which are crucial for accurate joint prediction. To address this, we introduce MERGE (Multi-faceted hiErarchical gRaph for Gene Expressions), which combines a multi-faceted hierarchical graph construction strategy with graph neural networks (GNN) to improve gene expression predictions from WSIs. By clustering tissue image patches based on both spatial and morphological features, and incorporating intra- and inter-cluster edges, our approach fosters interactions between distant tissue locations during GNN learning. As an additional contribution, we evaluate different data smoothing techniques that are necessary to mitigate artifacts in ST data, often caused by technical imperfections. We advocate for adopting gene-aware smoothing methods that are more biologically justified. Experimental results on gene expression prediction show that our GNN method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques across multiple metrics. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02601v1) | N/A |
| RoboPEPP: Vision-Based Robot Pose and Joint Angle Estimation through Embedding Predictive Pre-Training | Raktim Gautam Goswami, Prashanth Krishnamurthy, Yann LeCun, Farshad Khorrami | Vision-based pose estimation of articulated robots with unknown joint angles has applications in collaborative robotics and human-robot interaction tasks. Current frameworks use neural network encoders to extract image features and downstream layers to predict joint angles and robot pose. While images of robots inherently contain rich information about the robot's physical structures, existing methods often fail to leverage it fully; therefore, limiting performance under occlusions and truncations. To address this, we introduce RoboPEPP, a method that fuses information about the robot's physical model into the encoder using a masking-based self-supervised embedding-predictive architecture. Specifically, we mask the robot's joints and pre-train an encoder-predictor model to infer the joints' embeddings from surrounding unmasked regions, enhancing the encoder's understanding of the robot's physical model. The pre-trained encoder-predictor pair, along with joint angle and keypoint prediction networks, is then fine-tuned for pose and joint angle estimation. Random masking of input during fine-tuning and keypoint filtering during evaluation further improves robustness. Our method, evaluated on several datasets, achieves the best results in robot pose and joint angle estimation while being the least sensitive to occlusions and requiring the lowest execution time. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.17662v1) | N/A |
| GenDeg: Diffusion-Based Degradation Synthesis for Generalizable All-in-One Image Restoration | Sudarshan Rajagopalan, Nithin Gopalakrishnan Nair, Jay N. Paranjape, Vishal M. Patel | Deep learning-based models for All-In-One Image Restoration (AIOR) have achieved significant advancements in recent years. However, their practical applicability is limited by poor generalization to samples outside the training distribution. This limitation arises primarily from insufficient diversity in degradation variations and scenes within existing datasets, resulting in inadequate representations of real-world scenarios. Additionally, capturing large-scale real-world paired data for degradations such as haze, low-light, and raindrops is often cumbersome and sometimes infeasible. In this paper, we leverage the generative capabilities of latent diffusion models to synthesize high-quality degraded images from their clean counterparts. Specifically, we introduce GenDeg, a degradation and intensity-aware conditional diffusion model capable of producing diverse degradation patterns on clean images. Using GenDeg, we synthesize over 550k samples across six degradation types: haze, rain, snow, motion blur, low-light, and raindrops. These generated samples are integrated with existing datasets to form the GenDS dataset, comprising over 750k samples. Our experiments reveal that image restoration models trained on the GenDS dataset exhibit significant improvements in out-of-distribution performance compared to those trained solely on existing datasets. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive analyses on the implications of diffusion model-based synthetic degradations for AIOR. The code will be made publicly available. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.17687v1) | [https://sudraj2002.github.io/gendegpage](https://sudraj2002.github.io/gendegpage) |
| TIMotion: Temporal and Interactive Framework for Efficient Human-Human Motion Generation | Yabiao Wang, Shuo Wang, Jiangning Zhang, Ke Fan, Jiafu Wu, Zhucun Xue, Yong Liu | Human-human motion generation is essential for understanding humans as social beings. Current methods fall into two main categories: single-person-based methods and separate modeling-based methods. To delve into this field, we abstract the overall generation process into a general framework MetaMotion, which consists of two phases: temporal modeling and interaction mixing. For temporal modeling, the single-person-based methods concatenate two people into a single one directly, while the separate modeling-based methods skip the modeling of interaction sequences. The inadequate modeling described above resulted in sub-optimal performance and redundant model parameters. In this paper, we introduce TIMotion (Temporal and Interactive Modeling), an efficient and effective framework for human-human motion generation. Specifically, we first propose Causal Interactive Injection to model two separate sequences as a causal sequence leveraging the temporal and causal properties. Then we present Role-Evolving Scanning to adjust to the change in the active and passive roles throughout the interaction. Finally, to generate smoother and more rational motion, we design Localized Pattern Amplification to capture short-term motion patterns. Extensive experiments on InterHuman and InterX demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance. The project code will be released upon acceptance.

| FALCON: Fairness Learning via Contrastive Attention Approach to Continual Semantic Scene Understanding | Thanh-Dat Truong, Utsav Prabhu, Bhiksha Raj, Jackson Cothren, Khoa Luu | Continual Learning in semantic scene segmentation aims to continually learn new unseen classes in dynamic environments while maintaining previously learned knowledge. Prior studies focused on modeling the catastrophic forgetting and background shift challenges in continual learning. However, fairness, another major challenge that causes unfair predictions leading to low performance among major and minor classes, still needs to be well addressed. In addition, prior methods have yet to model the unknown classes well, thus resulting in producing non-discriminative features among unknown classes. This paper presents a novel Fairness Learning via Contrastive Attention Approach to continual learning in semantic scene understanding. In particular, we first introduce a new Fairness Contrastive Clustering loss to address the problems of catastrophic forgetting and fairness. Then, we propose an attention-based visual grammar approach to effectively model the background shift problem and unknown classes, producing better feature representations for different unknown classes. Through our experiments, our proposed approach achieves State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance on different continual learning benchmarks, i.e., ADE20K, Cityscapes, and Pascal VOC. It promotes the fairness of the continual semantic segmentation model. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.15965v2) | N/A |
| Believing is Seeing: Unobserved Object Detection using Generative Models | Subhransu S. Bhattacharjee, Dylan Campbell, Rahul Shome | Can objects that are not visible in an image -- but are in the vicinity of the camera -- be detected? This study introduces the novel tasks of 2D, 2.5D and 3D unobserved object detection for predicting the location of nearby objects that are occluded or lie outside the image frame. We adapt several state-of-the-art pre-trained generative models to address this task, including 2D and 3D diffusion models and vision-language models, and show that they can be used to infer the presence of objects that are not directly observed. To benchmark this task, we propose a suite of metrics that capture different aspects of performance. Our empirical evaluation on indoor scenes from the RealEstate10k and NYU Depth v2 datasets demonstrate results that motivate the use of generative models for the unobserved object detection task. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05869v2) | [https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) |
| Video Depth without Video Models | Bingxin Ke, Dominik Narnhofer, Shengyu Huang, Lei Ke, Torben Peters, Katerina Fragkiadaki, Anton Obukhov, Konrad Schindler | Video depth estimation lifts monocular video clips to 3D by inferring dense depth at every frame. Recent advances in single-image depth estimation, brought about by the rise of large foundation models and the use of synthetic training data, have fueled a renewed interest in video depth. However, naively applying a single-image depth estimator to every frame of a video disregards temporal continuity, which not only leads to flickering but may also break when camera motion causes sudden changes in depth range. An obvious and principled solution would be to build on top of video foundation models, but these come with their own limitations; including expensive training and inference, imperfect 3D consistency, and stitching routines for the fixed-length (short) outputs. We take a step back and demonstrate how to turn a single-image latent diffusion model (LDM) into a state-of-the-art video depth estimator. Our model, which we call RollingDepth, has two main ingredients: (i) a multi-frame depth estimator that is derived from a single-image LDM and maps very short video snippets (typically frame triplets) to depth snippets. (ii) a robust, optimization-based registration algorithm that optimally assembles depth snippets sampled at various different frame rates back into a consistent video. RollingDepth is able to efficiently handle long videos with hundreds of frames and delivers more accurate depth videos than both dedicated video depth estimators and high-performing single-frame models.

| Turbo3D: Ultra-fast Text-to-3D Generation | Hanzhe Hu, Tianwei Yin, Fujun Luan, Yiwei Hu, Hao Tan, Zexiang Xu, Sai Bi, Shubham Tulsiani, Kai Zhang | We present Turbo3D, an ultra-fast text-to-3D system capable of generating high-quality Gaussian splatting assets in under one second. Turbo3D employs a rapid 4-step, 4-view diffusion generator and an efficient feed-forward Gaussian reconstructor, both operating in latent space. The 4-step, 4-view generator is a student model distilled through a novel Dual-Teacher approach, which encourages the student to learn view consistency from a multi-view teacher and photo-realism from a single-view teacher. By shifting the Gaussian reconstructor's inputs from pixel space to latent space, we eliminate the extra image decoding time and halve the transformer sequence length for maximum efficiency. Our method demonstrates superior 3D generation results compared to previous baselines, while operating in a fraction of their runtime. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04470v1) | N/A |
| ViiNeuS: Volumetric Initialization for Implicit Neural Surface reconstruction of urban scenes with limited image overlap | Hala Djeghim, Nathan Piasco, Moussab Bennehar, Luis Roldão, Dzmitry Tsishkou, Désiré Sidibé | Neural implicit surface representation methods have recently shown impressive 3D reconstruction results. However, existing solutions struggle to reconstruct driving scenes due to their large size, highly complex nature and their limited visual observation overlap. Hence, to achieve accurate reconstructions, additional supervision data such as LiDAR, strong geometric priors, and long training times are required. To tackle such limitations, we present ViiNeuS, a new hybrid implicit surface learning method that efficiently initializes the signed distance field to reconstruct large driving scenes from 2D street view images. ViiNeuS's hybrid architecture models two separate implicit fields: one representing the volumetric density of the scene, and another one representing the signed distance to the surface. To accurately reconstruct urban outdoor driving scenarios, we introduce a novel volume-rendering strategy that relies on self-supervised probabilistic density estimation to sample points near the surface and transition progressively from volumetric to surface representation. Our solution permits a proper and fast initialization of the signed distance field without relying on any geometric prior on the scene, compared to concurrent methods. By conducting extensive experiments on four outdoor driving datasets, we show that ViiNeuS can learn an accurate and detailed 3D surface representation of various urban scene while being two times faster to train compared to previous state-of-the-art solutions. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.10344v5) | [https://github.com/NVlabs/neuralangelo](https://github.com/NVlabs/neuralangelo) |
| SemanticDraw: Towards Real-Time Interactive Content Creation from Image Diffusion Models | Jaerin Lee, Daniel Sungho Jung, Kanggeon Lee, Kyoung Mu Lee | We introduce SemanticDraw, a new paradigm of interactive content creation where high-quality images are generated in near real-time from given multiple hand-drawn regions, each encoding prescribed semantic meaning. In order to maximize the productivity of content creators and to fully realize their artistic imagination, it requires both quick interactive interfaces and fine-grained regional controls in their tools. Despite astonishing generation quality from recent diffusion models, we find that existing approaches for regional controllability are very slow (52 seconds for $512 \times 512$ image) while not compatible with acceleration methods such as LCM, blocking their huge potential in interactive content creation. From this observation, we build our solution for interactive content creation in two steps: (1) we establish compatibility between region-based controls and acceleration techniques for diffusion models, maintaining high fidelity of multi-prompt image generation with $\times 10$ reduced number of inference steps, (2) we increase the generation throughput with our new multi-prompt stream batch pipeline, enabling low-latency generation from multiple, region-based text prompts on a single RTX 2080 Ti GPU. Our proposed framework is generalizable to any existing diffusion models and acceleration schedulers, allowing sub-second (0.64 seconds) image content creation application upon well-established image diffusion models.

| ESCAPE: Equivariant Shape Completion via Anchor Point Encoding | Burak Bekci, Nassir Navab, Federico Tombari, Mahdi Saleh | Shape completion, a crucial task in 3D computer vision, involves predicting and filling the missing regions of scanned or partially observed objects. Current methods expect known pose or canonical coordinates and do not perform well under varying rotations, limiting their real-world applicability. We introduce ESCAPE (Equivariant Shape Completion via Anchor Point Encoding), a novel framework designed to achieve rotation-equivariant shape completion. Our approach employs a distinctive encoding strategy by selecting anchor points from a shape and representing all points as a distance to all anchor points. This enables the model to capture a consistent, rotation-equivariant understanding of the object's geometry. ESCAPE leverages a transformer architecture to encode and decode the distance transformations, ensuring that generated shape completions remain accurate and equivariant under rotational transformations. Subsequently, we perform optimization to calculate the predicted shapes from the encodings. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that ESCAPE achieves robust, high-quality reconstructions across arbitrary rotations and translations, showcasing its effectiveness in real-world applications without additional pose estimation modules. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.00952v1) | N/A |
| EZSR: Event-based Zero-Shot Recognition | Yan Yang, Liyuan Pan, Dongxu Li, Liu Liu | This paper studies zero-shot object recognition using event camera data. Guided by CLIP, which is pre-trained on RGB images, existing approaches achieve zero-shot object recognition by optimizing embedding similarities between event data and RGB images respectively encoded by an event encoder and the CLIP image encoder. Alternatively, several methods learn RGB frame reconstructions from event data for the CLIP image encoder. However, they often result in suboptimal zero-shot performance.   This study develops an event encoder without relying on additional reconstruction networks. We theoretically analyze the performance bottlenecks of previous approaches: the embedding optimization objectives are prone to suffer from the spatial sparsity of event data, causing semantic misalignments between the learned event embedding space and the CLIP text embedding space. To mitigate the issue, we explore a scalar-wise modulation strategy. Furthermore, to scale up the number of events and RGB data pairs for training, we also study a pipeline for synthesizing event data from static RGB images in mass.   Experimentally, we demonstrate an attractive scaling property in the number of parameters and synthesized data. We achieve superior zero-shot object recognition performance on extensive standard benchmark datasets, even compared with past supervised learning approaches. For example, our model with a ViT/B-16 backbone achieves 47.84% zero-shot accuracy on the N-ImageNet dataset. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21616v2) | [https://yan98.github.io/EZSR](https://yan98.github.io/EZSR) |
| See Further When Clear: Curriculum Consistency Model | Yunpeng Liu, Boxiao Liu, Yi Zhang, Xingzhong Hou, Guanglu Song, Yu Liu, Haihang You | Significant advances have been made in the sampling efficiency of diffusion models and flow matching models, driven by Consistency Distillation (CD), which trains a student model to mimic the output of a teacher model at a later timestep. However, we found that the learning complexity of the student model varies significantly across different timesteps, leading to suboptimal performance in CD.To address this issue, we propose the Curriculum Consistency Model (CCM), which stabilizes and balances the learning complexity across timesteps. Specifically, we regard the distillation process at each timestep as a curriculum and introduce a metric based on Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) to quantify the learning complexity of this curriculum, then ensure that the curriculum maintains consistent learning complexity across different timesteps by having the teacher model iterate more steps when the noise intensity is low. Our method achieves competitive single-step sampling Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) scores of 1.64 on CIFAR-10 and 2.18 on ImageNet 64x64.Moreover, we have extended our method to large-scale text-to-image models and confirmed that it generalizes well to both diffusion models (Stable Diffusion XL) and flow matching models (Stable Diffusion 3). The generated samples demonstrate improved image-text alignment and semantic structure, since CCM enlarges the distillation step at large timesteps and reduces the accumulated error. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06295v1) | N/A |
| SeeGround: See and Ground for Zero-Shot Open-Vocabulary 3D Visual Grounding | Rong Li, Shijie Li, Lingdong Kong, Xulei Yang, Junwei Liang | 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to locate objects in 3D scenes based on textual descriptions, which is essential for applications like augmented reality and robotics. Traditional 3DVG approaches rely on annotated 3D datasets and predefined object categories, limiting scalability and adaptability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SeeGround, a zero-shot 3DVG framework leveraging 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained on large-scale 2D data. We propose to represent 3D scenes as a hybrid of query-aligned rendered images and spatially enriched text descriptions, bridging the gap between 3D data and 2D-VLMs input formats. We propose two modules: the Perspective Adaptation Module, which dynamically selects viewpoints for query-relevant image rendering, and the Fusion Alignment Module, which integrates 2D images with 3D spatial descriptions to enhance object localization. Extensive experiments on ScanRefer and Nr3D demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing zero-shot methods by large margins. Notably, we exceed weakly supervised methods and rival some fully supervised ones, outperforming previous SOTA by 7.7% on ScanRefer and 7.1% on Nr3D, showcasing its effectiveness. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04383v1) | [https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch), [https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d), [https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D](https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D), [https://github.com/referit3d/referit3d](https://github.com/referit3d/referit3d), [https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2-VL](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2-VL), [https://github.com/CurryYuan/ZSVG3D](https://github.com/CurryYuan/ZSVG3D), [https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm), [https://github.com/pengsongyou/openscene](https://github.com/pengsongyou/openscene), [https://github.com/cshizhe/vil3dref](https://github.com/cshizhe/vil3dref), [https://github.com/Pointcept/OpenIns3D](https://github.com/Pointcept/OpenIns3D), [https://github.com/OpenRobotLab/EmbodiedScan](https://github.com/OpenRobotLab/EmbodiedScan), [https://github.com/eslambakr/LAR-Look-Around-](https://github.com/eslambakr/LAR-Look-Around-), [https://daveredrum.github.io/ScanRefer](https://daveredrum.github.io/ScanRefer), [https://huggingface.co/OpenGVLab/InternVL2-26B](https://huggingface.co/OpenGVLab/InternVL2-26B) |

In this research, we propose an EmotiveTalk framework to address these issues. Firstly, to realize better control over the generation of lip movement and facial expression, a Vision-guided Audio Information Decoupling (V-AID) approach is designed to generate audio-based decoupled representations aligned with lip movements and expression. Specifically, to achieve alignment between audio and facial expression representation spaces, we present a Diffusion-based Co-speech Temporal Expansion (Di-CTE) module within V-AID to generate expression-related representations under multi-source emotion condition constraints. Then we propose a well-designed Emotional Talking Head Diffusion (ETHD) backbone to efficiently generate highly expressive talking head videos, which contains an Expression Decoupling Injection (EDI) module to automatically decouple the expressions from reference portraits while integrating the target expression information, achieving more expressive generation performance. Experimental results show that EmotiveTalk can generate expressive talking head videos, ensuring the promised controllability of emotions and stability during long-time generation, yielding state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16726v2) | [https://github.com/mseitzer/pytorch-fid](https://github.com/mseitzer/pytorch-fid) |
| Model Poisoning Attacks to Federated Learning via Multi-Round Consistency | Yueqi Xie, Minghong Fang, Neil Zhenqiang Gong | Model poisoning attacks are critical security threats to Federated Learning (FL). Existing model poisoning attacks suffer from two key limitations: 1) they achieve suboptimal effectiveness when defenses are deployed, and/or 2) they require knowledge of the model updates or local training data on genuine clients. In this work, we make a key observation that their suboptimal effectiveness arises from only leveraging model-update consistency among malicious clients within individual training rounds, making the attack effect self-cancel across training rounds. In light of this observation, we propose PoisonedFL, which enforces multi-round consistency among the malicious clients' model updates while not requiring any knowledge about the genuine clients. Our empirical evaluation on five benchmark datasets shows that PoisonedFL breaks eight state-of-the-art defenses and outperforms seven existing model poisoning attacks. Moreover, we also explore new defenses that are tailored to PoisonedFL, but our results show that we can still adapt PoisonedFL to break them. Our study shows that FL systems are considerably less robust than previously thought, underlining the urgency for the development of new defense mechanisms. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15611v2) | N/A |
| JamMa: Ultra-lightweight Local Feature Matching with Joint Mamba | Xiaoyong Lu, Songlin Du | Existing state-of-the-art feature matchers capture long-range dependencies with Transformers but are hindered by high spatial complexity, leading to demanding training and highlatency inference. Striking a better balance between performance and efficiency remains a challenge in feature matching. Inspired by the linear complexity O(N) of Mamba, we propose an ultra-lightweight Mamba-based matcher, named JamMa, which converges on a single GPU and achieves an impressive performance-efficiency balance in inference. To unlock the potential of Mamba for feature matching, we propose Joint Mamba with a scan-merge strategy named JEGO, which enables: (1) Joint scan of two images to achieve high-frequency mutual interaction, (2) Efficient scan with skip steps to reduce sequence length, (3) Global receptive field, and (4) Omnidirectional feature representation. With the above properties, the JEGO strategy significantly outperforms the scan-merge strategies proposed in VMamba and EVMamba in the feature matching task. Compared to attention-based sparse and semi-dense matchers, JamMa demonstrates a superior balance between performance and efficiency, delivering better performance with less than 50% of the parameters and FLOPs. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.03437v1) | [https://leoluxxx.github.io/JamMa-page](https://leoluxxx.github.io/JamMa-page) |

| SplatFlow: Self-Supervised Dynamic Gaussian Splatting in Neural Motion Flow Field for Autonomous Driving | Su Sun, Cheng Zhao, Zhuoyang Sun, Yingjie Victor Chen, Mei Chen | Most existing Dynamic Gaussian Splatting methods for complex dynamic urban scenarios rely on accurate object-level supervision from expensive manual labeling, limiting their scalability in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce SplatFlow, a Self-Supervised Dynamic Gaussian Splatting within Neural Motion Flow Fields (NMFF) to learn 4D space-time representations without requiring tracked 3D bounding boxes, enabling accurate dynamic scene reconstruction and novel view RGB, depth and flow synthesis. SplatFlow designs a unified framework to seamlessly integrate time-dependent 4D Gaussian representation within NMFF, where NMFF is a set of implicit functions to model temporal motions of both LiDAR points and Gaussians as continuous motion flow fields. Leveraging NMFF, SplatFlow effectively decomposes static background and dynamic objects, representing them with 3D and 4D Gaussian primitives, respectively. NMFF also models the status correspondences of each 4D Gaussian across time, which aggregates temporal features to enhance cross-view consistency of dynamic components. SplatFlow further improves dynamic scene identification by distilling features from 2D foundational models into 4D space-time representation. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on the Waymo Open Dataset and KITTI Dataset validate SplatFlow's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for both image reconstruction and novel view synthesis in dynamic urban scenarios. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.15482v1) | N/A |
| Dual Exposure Stereo for Extended Dynamic Range 3D Imaging | Juhyung Choi, Jinnyeong Kim, Seokjun Choi, Jinwoo Lee, Samuel Brucker, Mario Bijelic, Felix Heide, Seung-Hwan Baek | Achieving robust stereo 3D imaging under diverse illumination conditions is an important however challenging task, due to the limited dynamic ranges (DRs) of cameras, which are significantly smaller than real world DR. As a result, the accuracy of existing stereo depth estimation methods is often compromised by under- or over-exposed images. Here, we introduce dual-exposure stereo for extended dynamic range 3D imaging. We develop automatic dual-exposure control method that adjusts the dual exposures, diverging them when the scene DR exceeds the camera DR, thereby providing information about broader DR. From the captured dual-exposure stereo images, we estimate depth using motion-aware dual-exposure stereo network. To validate our method, we develop a robot-vision system, collect stereo video datasets, and generate a synthetic dataset. Our method outperforms other exposure control methods. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02351v1) | N/A |
| IRGS: Inter-Reflective Gaussian Splatting with 2D Gaussian Ray Tracing | Chun Gu, Xiaofei Wei, Zixuan Zeng, Yuxuan Yao, Li Zhang | In inverse rendering, accurately modeling visibility and indirect radiance for incident light is essential for capturing secondary effects. Due to the absence of a powerful Gaussian ray tracer, previous 3DGS-based methods have either adopted a simplified rendering equation or used learnable parameters to approximate incident light, resulting in inaccurate material and lighting estimations. To this end, we introduce inter-reflective Gaussian splatting (IRGS) for inverse rendering. To capture inter-reflection, we apply the full rendering equation without simplification and compute incident radiance on the fly using the proposed differentiable 2D Gaussian ray tracing. Additionally, we present an efficient optimization scheme to handle the computational demands of Monte Carlo sampling for rendering equation evaluation. Furthermore, we introduce a novel strategy for querying the indirect radiance of incident light when relighting the optimized scenes. Extensive experiments on multiple standard benchmarks validate the effectiveness of IRGS, demonstrating its capability to accurately model complex inter-reflection effects. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15867v1) | [https://fudan-zvg.github.io/IRGS](https://fudan-zvg.github.io/IRGS) |
| LineArt: A Knowledge-guided Training-free High-quality Appearance Transfer for Design Drawing with Diffusion Model | Xi Wang, Hongzhen Li, Heng Fang, Yichen Peng, Haoran Xie, Xi Yang, Chuntao Li | Image rendering from line drawings is vital in design and image generation technologies reduce costs, yet professional line drawings demand preserving complex details. Text prompts struggle with accuracy, and image translation struggles with consistency and fine-grained control. We present LineArt, a framework that transfers complex appearance onto detailed design drawings, facilitating design and artistic creation. It generates high-fidelity appearance while preserving structural accuracy by simulating hierarchical visual cognition and integrating human artistic experience to guide the diffusion process. LineArt overcomes the limitations of current methods in terms of difficulty in fine-grained control and style degradation in design drawings. It requires no precise 3D modeling, physical property specs, or network training, making it more convenient for design tasks. LineArt consists of two stages: a multi-frequency lines fusion module to supplement the input design drawing with detailed structural information and a two-part painting process for Base Layer Shaping and Surface Layer Coloring. We also present a new design drawing dataset ProLines for evaluation. The experiments show that LineArt performs better in accuracy, realism, and material precision compared to SOTAs. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11519v1) | N/A |
| MICAS: Multi-grained In-Context Adaptive Sampling for 3D Point Cloud Processing | Feifei Shao, Ping Liu, Zhao Wang, Yawei Luo, Hongwei Wang, Jun Xiao | Point cloud processing (PCP) encompasses tasks like reconstruction, denoising, registration, and segmentation, each often requiring specialized models to address unique task characteristics. While in-context learning (ICL) has shown promise across tasks by using a single model with task-specific demonstration prompts, its application to PCP reveals significant limitations. We identify inter-task and intra-task sensitivity issues in current ICL methods for PCP, which we attribute to inflexible sampling strategies lacking context adaptation at the point and prompt levels. To address these challenges, we propose MICAS, an advanced ICL framework featuring a multi-grained adaptive sampling mechanism tailored for PCP. MICAS introduces two core components: task-adaptive point sampling, which leverages inter-task cues for point-level sampling, and query-specific prompt sampling, which selects optimal prompts per query to mitigate intra-task sensitivity. To our knowledge, this is the first approach to introduce adaptive sampling tailored to the unique requirements of point clouds within an ICL framework. Extensive experiments show that MICAS not only efficiently handles various PCP tasks but also significantly outperforms existing methods. Notably, it achieves a remarkable $4.1\%$ improvement in the part segmentation task and delivers consistent gains across various PCP applications. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16773v2) | N/A |
| Are Images Indistinguishable to Humans Also Indistinguishable to Classifiers? | Zebin You, Xinyu Zhang, Hanzhong Guo, Jingdong Wang, Chongxuan Li | The ultimate goal of generative models is to perfectly capture the data distribution. For image generation, common metrics of visual quality (e.g., FID) and the perceived truthfulness of generated images seem to suggest that we are nearing this goal. However, through distribution classification tasks, we reveal that, from the perspective of neural network-based classifiers, even advanced diffusion models are still far from this goal. Specifically, classifiers are able to consistently and effortlessly distinguish real images from generated ones across various settings. Moreover, we uncover an intriguing discrepancy: classifiers can easily differentiate between diffusion models with comparable performance (e.g., U-ViT-H vs. DiT-XL), but struggle to distinguish between models within the same family but of different scales (e.g., EDM2-XS vs. EDM2-XXL). Our methodology carries several important implications. First, it naturally serves as a diagnostic tool for diffusion models by analyzing specific features of generated data. Second, it sheds light on the model autophagy disorder and offers insights into the use of generated data: augmenting real data with generated data is more effective than replacing it. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.18029v3) | [https://github.com/facebookresearch/ConvNeXt](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ConvNeXt), [https://github.com/baofff/U-ViT](https://github.com/baofff/U-ViT), [https://github.com/facebookresearch/DiT](https://github.com/facebookresearch/DiT), [https://github.com/NVlabs/edm](https://github.com/NVlabs/edm), [https://github.com/NVlabs/edm2](https://github.com/NVlabs/edm2) |
| Discovering Hidden Visual Concepts Beyond Linguistic Input in Infant Learning | Xueyi Ke, Satoshi Tsutsui, Yayun Zhang, Bihan Wen | Infants develop complex visual understanding rapidly, even preceding of the acquisition of linguistic inputs. As computer vision seeks to replicate the human vision system, understanding infant visual development may offer valuable insights. In this paper, we present an interdisciplinary study exploring this question: can a computational model that imitates the infant learning process develop broader visual concepts that extend beyond the vocabulary it has heard, similar to how infants naturally learn? To investigate this, we analyze a recently published model in Science by Vong et al.,which is trained on longitudinal, egocentric images of a single child paired with transcribed parental speech. We introduce a training-free framework that can discover visual concept neurons hidden in the model's internal representations. Our findings show that these neurons can classify objects outside its original vocabulary. Furthermore, we compare the visual representations in infant-like models with those in moder computer vision models, such as CLIP or ImageNet pre-trained model, highlighting key similarities and differences. Ultimately, our work bridges cognitive science and computer vision by analyzing the internal representations of a computational model trained on an infant's visual and linguistic inputs. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05205v2) | N/A |
| FloVD: Optical Flow Meets Video Diffusion Model for Enhanced Camera-Controlled Video Synthesis | Wonjoon Jin, Qi Dai, Chong Luo, Seung-Hwan Baek, Sunghyun Cho | This paper presents FloVD, a novel optical-flow-based video diffusion model for camera-controllable video generation. FloVD leverages optical flow maps to represent motions of the camera and moving objects. This approach offers two key benefits. Since optical flow can be directly estimated from videos, our approach allows for the use of arbitrary training videos without ground-truth camera parameters. Moreover, as background optical flow encodes 3D correlation across different viewpoints, our method enables detailed camera control by leveraging the background motion. To synthesize natural object motion while supporting detailed camera control, our framework adopts a two-stage video synthesis pipeline consisting of optical flow generation and flow-conditioned video synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over previous approaches in terms of accurate camera control and natural object motion synthesis. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08244v1) | N/A |
| UrbanCAD: Towards Highly Controllable and Photorealistic 3D Vehicles for Urban Scene Simulation | Yichong Lu, Yichi Cai, Shangzhan Zhang, Hongyu Zhou, Haoji Hu, Huimin Yu, Andreas Geiger, Yiyi Liao | Photorealistic 3D vehicle models with high controllability are essential for autonomous driving simulation and data augmentation. While handcrafted CAD models provide flexible controllability, free CAD libraries often lack the high-quality materials necessary for photorealistic rendering. Conversely, reconstructed 3D models offer high-fidelity rendering but lack controllability. In this work, we introduce UrbanCAD, a framework that pushes the frontier of the photorealism-controllability trade-off by generating highly controllable and photorealistic 3D vehicle digital twins from a single urban image and a collection of free 3D CAD models and handcrafted materials. These digital twins enable realistic 360-degree rendering, vehicle insertion, material transfer, relighting, and component manipulation such as opening doors and rolling down windows, supporting the construction of long-tail scenarios. To achieve this, we propose a novel pipeline that operates in a retrieval-optimization manner, adapting to observational data while preserving flexible controllability and fine-grained handcrafted details. Furthermore, given multi-view background perspective and fisheye images, we approximate environment lighting using fisheye images and reconstruct the background with 3DGS, enabling the photorealistic insertion of optimized CAD models into rendered novel view backgrounds. Experimental results demonstrate that UrbanCAD outperforms baselines based on reconstruction and retrieval in terms of photorealism. Additionally, we show that various perception models maintain their accuracy when evaluated on UrbanCAD with in-distribution configurations but degrade when applied to realistic out-of-distribution data generated by our method. This suggests that UrbanCAD is a significant advancement in creating photorealistic, safety-critical driving scenarios for downstream applications. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.19292v1) | [https://xdimlab.github.io/UrbanCAD](https://xdimlab.github.io/UrbanCAD) |
| Novel View Synthesis with Pixel-Space Diffusion Models | Noam Elata, Bahjat Kawar, Yaron Ostrovsky-Berman, Miriam Farber, Ron Sokolovsky | Synthesizing a novel view from a single input image is a challenging task. Traditionally, this task was approached by estimating scene depth, warping, and inpainting, with machine learning models enabling parts of the pipeline. More recently, generative models are being increasingly employed in novel view synthesis (NVS), often encompassing the entire end-to-end system. In this work, we adapt a modern diffusion model architecture for end-to-end NVS in the pixel space, substantially outperforming previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques. We explore different ways to encode geometric information into the network. Our experiments show that while these methods may enhance performance, their impact is minor compared to utilizing improved generative models. Moreover, we introduce a novel NVS training scheme that utilizes single-view datasets, capitalizing on their relative abundance compared to their multi-view counterparts. This leads to improved generalization capabilities to scenes with out-of-domain content. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07765v1) | N/A |
| SMTPD: A New Benchmark for Temporal Prediction of Social Media Popularity | Yijie Xu, Bolun Zheng, Wei Zhu, Hangjia Pan, Yuchen Yao, Ning Xu, Anan Liu, Quan Zhang, Chenggang Yan | Social media popularity prediction task aims to predict the popularity of posts on social media platforms, which has a positive driving effect on application scenarios such as content optimization, digital marketing and online advertising. Though many studies have made significant progress, few of them pay much attention to the integration between popularity prediction with temporal alignment. In this paper, with exploring YouTube's multilingual and multi-modal content, we construct a new social media temporal popularity prediction benchmark, namely SMTPD, and suggest a baseline framework for temporal popularity prediction. Through data analysis and experiments, we verify that temporal alignment and early popularity play crucial roles in social media popularity prediction for not only deepening the understanding of temporal dynamics of popularity in social media but also offering a suggestion about developing more effective prediction models in this field.

| FluidNexus: 3D Fluid Reconstruction and Prediction from a Single Video | Yue Gao, Hong-Xing Yu, Bo Zhu, Jiajun Wu | We study reconstructing and predicting 3D fluid appearance and velocity from a single video. Current methods require multi-view videos for fluid reconstruction. We present FluidNexus, a novel framework that bridges video generation and physics simulation to tackle this task. Our key insight is to synthesize multiple novel-view videos as references for reconstruction. FluidNexus consists of two key components: (1) a novel-view video synthesizer that combines frame-wise view synthesis with video diffusion refinement for generating realistic videos, and (2) a physics-integrated particle representation coupling differentiable simulation and rendering to simultaneously facilitate 3D fluid reconstruction and prediction. To evaluate our approach, we collect two new real-world fluid datasets featuring textured backgrounds and object interactions. Our method enables dynamic novel view synthesis, future prediction, and interaction simulation from a single fluid video.

| ShowUI: One Vision-Language-Action Model for GUI Visual Agent | Kevin Qinghong Lin, Linjie Li, Difei Gao, Zhengyuan Yang, Shiwei Wu, Zechen Bai, Weixian Lei, Lijuan Wang, Mike Zheng Shou | Building Graphical User Interface (GUI) assistants holds significant promise for enhancing human workflow productivity. While most agents are language-based, relying on closed-source API with text-rich meta-information (e.g., HTML or accessibility tree), they show limitations in perceiving UI visuals as humans do, highlighting the need for GUI visual agents. In this work, we develop a vision-language-action model in digital world, namely ShowUI, which features the following innovations: (i) UI-Guided Visual Token Selection to reduce computational costs by formulating screenshots as an UI connected graph, adaptively identifying their redundant relationship and serve as the criteria for token selection during self-attention blocks; (ii) Interleaved Vision-Language-Action Streaming that flexibly unifies diverse needs within GUI tasks, enabling effective management of visual-action history in navigation or pairing multi-turn query-action sequences per screenshot to enhance training efficiency; (iii) Small-scale High-quality GUI Instruction-following Datasets by careful data curation and employing a resampling strategy to address significant data type imbalances. With above components, ShowUI, a lightweight 2B model using 256K data, achieves a strong 75.1% accuracy in zero-shot screenshot grounding. Its UI-guided token selection further reduces 33% of redundant visual tokens during training and speeds up the performance by 1.4x. Navigation experiments across web Mind2Web, mobile AITW, and online MiniWob environments further underscore the effectiveness and potential of our model in advancing GUI visual agents.

| RNG: Relightable Neural Gaussians | Jiahui Fan, Fujun Luan, Jian Yang, Miloš Hašan, Beibei Wang | 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown impressive results for the novel view synthesis task, where lighting is assumed to be fixed. However, creating relightable 3D assets, especially for objects with ill-defined shapes (fur, fabric, etc.), remains a challenging task. The decomposition between light, geometry, and material is ambiguous, especially if either smooth surface assumptions or surfacebased analytical shading models do not apply. We propose Relightable Neural Gaussians (RNG), a novel 3DGS-based framework that enables the relighting of objects with both hard surfaces or soft boundaries, while avoiding assumptions on the shading model. We condition the radiance at each point on both view and light directions. We also introduce a shadow cue, as well as a depth refinement network to improve shadow accuracy. Finally, we propose a hybrid forward-deferred fitting strategy to balance geometry and appearance quality. Our method achieves significantly faster training (1.3 hours) and rendering (60 frames per second) compared to a prior method based on neural radiance fields and produces higher-quality shadows than a concurrent 3DGS-based method. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19702v4) | N/A |
| HoVLE: Unleashing the Power of Monolithic Vision-Language Models with Holistic Vision-Language Embedding | Chenxin Tao, Shiqian Su, Xizhou Zhu, Chenyu Zhang, Zhe Chen, Jiawen Liu, Wenhai Wang, Lewei Lu, Gao Huang, Yu Qiao, Jifeng Dai | The rapid advance of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed the development of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Monolithic VLMs, which avoid modality-specific encoders, offer a promising alternative to the compositional ones but face the challenge of inferior performance. Most existing monolithic VLMs require tuning pre-trained LLMs to acquire vision abilities, which may degrade their language capabilities. To address this dilemma, this paper presents a novel high-performance monolithic VLM named HoVLE. We note that LLMs have been shown capable of interpreting images, when image embeddings are aligned with text embeddings. The challenge for current monolithic VLMs actually lies in the lack of a holistic embedding module for both vision and language inputs. Therefore, HoVLE introduces a holistic embedding module that converts visual and textual inputs into a shared space, allowing LLMs to process images in the same way as texts. Furthermore, a multi-stage training strategy is carefully designed to empower the holistic embedding module. It is first trained to distill visual features from a pre-trained vision encoder and text embeddings from the LLM, enabling large-scale training with unpaired random images and text tokens. The whole model further undergoes next-token prediction on multi-modal data to align the embeddings. Finally, an instruction-tuning stage is incorporated. Our experiments show that HoVLE achieves performance close to leading compositional models on various benchmarks, outperforming previous monolithic models by a large margin.

| ACE: Anti-Editing Concept Erasure in Text-to-Image Models | Zihao Wang, Yuxiang Wei, Fan Li, Renjing Pei, Hang Xu, Wangmeng Zuo | Recent advance in text-to-image diffusion models have significantly facilitated the generation of high-quality images, but also raising concerns about the illegal creation of harmful content, such as copyrighted images. Existing concept erasure methods achieve superior results in preventing the production of erased concept from prompts, but typically perform poorly in preventing undesired editing. To address this issue, we propose an Anti-Editing Concept Erasure (ACE) method, which not only erases the target concept during generation but also filters out it during editing. Specifically, we propose to inject the erasure guidance into both conditional and the unconditional noise prediction, enabling the model to effectively prevent the creation of erasure concepts during both editing and generation. Furthermore, a stochastic correction guidance is introduced during training to address the erosion of unrelated concepts. We conducted erasure editing experiments with representative editing methods (i.e., LEDITS++ and MasaCtrl) to erase IP characters, and the results indicate that our ACE effectively filters out target concepts in both types of edits. Additional experiments on erasing explicit concepts and artistic styles further demonstrate that our ACE performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/120L020904/ACE. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01633v1) | N/A |
| StickMotion: Generating 3D Human Motions by Drawing a Stickman | Tao Wang, Zhihua Wu, Qiaozhi He, Jiaming Chu, Ling Qian, Yu Cheng, Junliang Xing, Jian Zhao, Lei Jin | Text-to-motion generation, which translates textual descriptions into human motions, has been challenging in accurately capturing detailed user-imagined motions from simple text inputs. This paper introduces StickMotion, an efficient diffusion-based network designed for multi-condition scenarios, which generates desired motions based on traditional text and our proposed stickman conditions for global and local control of these motions, respectively. We address the challenges introduced by the user-friendly stickman from three perspectives: 1) Data generation. We develop an algorithm to generate hand-drawn stickmen automatically across different dataset formats. 2) Multi-condition fusion. We propose a multi-condition module that integrates into the diffusion process and obtains outputs of all possible condition combinations, reducing computational complexity and enhancing StickMotion's performance compared to conventional approaches with the self-attention module. 3) Dynamic supervision. We empower StickMotion to make minor adjustments to the stickman's position within the output sequences, generating more natural movements through our proposed dynamic supervision strategy. Through quantitative experiments and user studies, sketching stickmen saves users about 51.5% of their time generating motions consistent with their imagination. Our codes, demos, and relevant data will be released to facilitate further research and validation within the scientific community. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04829v1) | N/A |
| Towards Visual Discrimination and Reasoning of Real-World Physical Dynamics: Physics-Grounded Anomaly Detection | Wenqiao Li, Yao Gu, Xintao Chen, Xiaohao Xu, Ming Hu, Xiaonan Huang, Yingna Wu | Humans detect real-world object anomalies by perceiving, interacting, and reasoning based on object-conditioned physical knowledge. The long-term goal of Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD) is to enable machines to autonomously replicate this skill. However, current IAD algorithms are largely developed and tested on static, semantically simple datasets, which diverge from real-world scenarios where physical understanding and reasoning are essential. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Physics Anomaly Detection (Phys-AD) dataset, the first large-scale, real-world, physics-grounded video dataset for industrial anomaly detection. Collected using a real robot arm and motor, Phys-AD provides a diverse set of dynamic, semantically rich scenarios. The dataset includes more than 6400 videos across 22 real-world object categories, interacting with robot arms and motors, and exhibits 47 types of anomalies. Anomaly detection in Phys-AD requires visual reasoning, combining both physical knowledge and video content to determine object abnormality. We benchmark state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods under three settings: unsupervised AD, weakly-supervised AD, and video-understanding AD, highlighting their limitations in handling physics-grounded anomalies. Additionally, we introduce the Physics Anomaly Explanation (PAEval) metric, designed to assess the ability of visual-language foundation models to not only detect anomalies but also provide accurate explanations for their underlying physical causes. Our dataset and benchmark will be publicly available. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.03562v2) | N/A |
| GEN3C: 3D-Informed World-Consistent Video Generation with Precise Camera Control | Xuanchi Ren, Tianchang Shen, Jiahui Huang, Huan Ling, Yifan Lu, Merlin Nimier-David, Thomas Müller, Alexander Keller, Sanja Fidler, Jun Gao | We present GEN3C, a generative video model with precise Camera Control and temporal 3D Consistency. Prior video models already generate realistic videos, but they tend to leverage little 3D information, leading to inconsistencies, such as objects popping in and out of existence. Camera control, if implemented at all, is imprecise, because camera parameters are mere inputs to the neural network which must then infer how the video depends on the camera. In contrast, GEN3C is guided by a 3D cache: point clouds obtained by predicting the pixel-wise depth of seed images or previously generated frames. When generating the next frames, GEN3C is conditioned on the 2D renderings of the 3D cache with the new camera trajectory provided by the user. Crucially, this means that GEN3C neither has to remember what it previously generated nor does it have to infer the image structure from the camera pose. The model, instead, can focus all its generative power on previously unobserved regions, as well as advancing the scene state to the next frame. Our results demonstrate more precise camera control than prior work, as well as state-of-the-art results in sparse-view novel view synthesis, even in challenging settings such as driving scenes and monocular dynamic video. Results are best viewed in videos.

| Probing the Mid-level Vision Capabilities of Self-Supervised Learning | Xuweiyi Chen, Markus Marks, Zezhou Cheng | Mid-level vision capabilities - such as generic object localization and 3D geometric understanding - are not only fundamental to human vision but are also crucial for many real-world applications of computer vision. These abilities emerge with minimal supervision during the early stages of human visual development. Despite their significance, current self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches are primarily designed and evaluated for high-level recognition tasks, leaving their mid-level vision capabilities largely unexamined.   In this study, we introduce a suite of benchmark protocols to systematically assess mid-level vision capabilities and present a comprehensive, controlled evaluation of 22 prominent SSL models across 8 mid-level vision tasks. Our experiments reveal a weak correlation between mid-level and high-level task performance. We also identify several SSL methods with highly imbalanced performance across mid-level and high-level capabilities, as well as some that excel in both. Additionally, we investigate key factors contributing to mid-level vision performance, such as pretraining objectives and network architectures. Our study provides a holistic and timely view of what SSL models have learned, complementing existing research that primarily focuses on high-level vision tasks. We hope our findings guide future SSL research to benchmark models not only on high-level vision tasks but on mid-level as well. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.17474v2) | N/A |
| RandAR: Decoder-only Autoregressive Visual Generation in Random Orders | Ziqi Pang, Tianyuan Zhang, Fujun Luan, Yunze Man, Hao Tan, Kai Zhang, William T. Freeman, Yu-Xiong Wang | We introduce RandAR, a decoder-only visual autoregressive (AR) model capable of generating images in arbitrary token orders. Unlike previous decoder-only AR models that rely on a predefined generation order, RandAR removes this inductive bias, unlocking new capabilities in decoder-only generation. Our essential design enables random order by inserting a "position instruction token" before each image token to be predicted, representing the spatial location of the next image token. Trained on randomly permuted token sequences -- a more challenging task than fixed-order generation, RandAR achieves comparable performance to its conventional raster-order counterpart. More importantly, decoder-only transformers trained from random orders acquire new capabilities. For the efficiency bottleneck of AR models, RandAR adopts parallel decoding with KV-Cache at inference time, enjoying 2.5x acceleration without sacrificing generation quality. Additionally, RandAR supports inpainting, outpainting and resolution extrapolation in a zero-shot manner. We hope RandAR inspires new directions for decoder-only visual generation models and broadens their applications across diverse scenarios.

| UNOPose: Unseen Object Pose Estimation with an Unposed RGB-D Reference Image | Xingyu Liu, Gu Wang, Ruida Zhang, Chenyangguang Zhang, Federico Tombari, Xiangyang Ji | Unseen object pose estimation methods often rely on CAD models or multiple reference views, making the onboarding stage costly. To simplify reference acquisition, we aim to estimate the unseen object's pose through a single unposed RGB-D reference image. While previous works leverage reference images as pose anchors to limit the range of relative pose, our scenario presents significant challenges since the relative transformation could vary across the entire SE(3) space. Moreover, factors like occlusion, sensor noise, and extreme geometry could result in low viewpoint overlap. To address these challenges, we present a novel approach and benchmark, termed UNOPose, for unseen one-reference-based object pose estimation. Building upon a coarse-to-fine paradigm, UNOPose constructs an SE(3)-invariant reference frame to standardize object representation despite pose and size variations. To alleviate small overlap across viewpoints, we recalibrate the weight of each correspondence based on its predicted likelihood of being within the overlapping region. Evaluated on our proposed benchmark based on the BOP Challenge, UNOPose demonstrates superior performance, significantly outperforming traditional and learning-based methods in the one-reference setting and remaining competitive with CAD-model-based methods. The code and dataset will be available. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16106v1) | N/A |
| Mind the Time: Temporally-Controlled Multi-Event Video Generation | Ziyi Wu, Aliaksandr Siarohin, Willi Menapace, Ivan Skorokhodov, Yuwei Fang, Varnith Chordia, Igor Gilitschenski, Sergey Tulyakov | Real-world videos consist of sequences of events. Generating such sequences with precise temporal control is infeasible with existing video generators that rely on a single paragraph of text as input. When tasked with generating multiple events described using a single prompt, such methods often ignore some of the events or fail to arrange them in the correct order. To address this limitation, we present MinT, a multi-event video generator with temporal control. Our key insight is to bind each event to a specific period in the generated video, which allows the model to focus on one event at a time. To enable time-aware interactions between event captions and video tokens, we design a time-based positional encoding method, dubbed ReRoPE. This encoding helps to guide the cross-attention operation. By fine-tuning a pre-trained video diffusion transformer on temporally grounded data, our approach produces coherent videos with smoothly connected events. For the first time in the literature, our model offers control over the timing of events in generated videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MinT outperforms existing open-source models by a large margin. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05263v1) | N/A |
| DeSplat: Decomposed Gaussian Splatting for Distractor-Free Rendering | Yihao Wang, Marcus Klasson, Matias Turkulainen, Shuzhe Wang, Juho Kannala, Arno Solin | Gaussian splatting enables fast novel view synthesis in static 3D environments. However, reconstructing real-world environments remains challenging as distractors or occluders break the multi-view consistency assumption required for accurate 3D reconstruction. Most existing methods rely on external semantic information from pre-trained models, introducing additional computational overhead as pre-processing steps or during optimization. In this work, we propose a novel method, DeSplat, that directly separates distractors and static scene elements purely based on volume rendering of Gaussian primitives. We initialize Gaussians within each camera view for reconstructing the view-specific distractors to separately model the static 3D scene and distractors in the alpha compositing stages. DeSplat yields an explicit scene separation of static elements and distractors, achieving comparable results to prior distractor-free approaches without sacrificing rendering speed.

| Textured Gaussians for Enhanced 3D Scene Appearance Modeling | Brian Chao, Hung-Yu Tseng, Lorenzo Porzi, Chen Gao, Tuotuo Li, Qinbo Li, Ayush Saraf, Jia-Bin Huang, Johannes Kopf, Gordon Wetzstein, Changil Kim | 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction and rendering technique due to its high-quality results and fast training and rendering time. However, pixels covered by the same Gaussian are always shaded in the same color up to a Gaussian falloff scaling factor. Furthermore, the finest geometric detail any individual Gaussian can represent is a simple ellipsoid. These properties of 3DGS greatly limit the expressivity of individual Gaussian primitives. To address these issues, we draw inspiration from texture and alpha mapping in traditional graphics and integrate it with 3DGS. Specifically, we propose a new generalized Gaussian appearance representation that augments each Gaussian with alpha~(A), RGB, or RGBA texture maps to model spatially varying color and opacity across the extent of each Gaussian. As such, each Gaussian can represent a richer set of texture patterns and geometric structures, instead of just a single color and ellipsoid as in naive Gaussian Splatting. Surprisingly, we found that the expressivity of Gaussians can be greatly improved by using alpha-only texture maps, and further augmenting Gaussians with RGB texture maps achieves the highest expressivity. We validate our method on a wide variety of standard benchmark datasets and our own custom captures at both the object and scene levels. We demonstrate image quality improvements over existing methods while using a similar or lower number of Gaussians. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18625v1) | N/A |
| Enhancing Vision-Language Compositional Understanding with Multimodal Synthetic Data | Haoxin Li, Boyang Li | Despite impressive advancements in various multimodal tasks, vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle with compositional understanding due to limited exposure to training samples that contain subtle variations within paired examples. With advances in multimodal generative models, a natural solution is to generate synthetic samples with subtle variations for training VLMs. However, generating and training on synthetic samples with subtle variations presents two challenges: difficulty in accurately creating precise variations and inconsistency in cross-modal alignment quality. To address these challenges, we propose SVD-GT (Subtle Variation Data Generation and Training), which integrates image feature injection into a text-to-image generative model to enhance the quality of synthetic variations and employs an adaptive margin loss to differentiate samples using adaptive margins, which help filter out potentially incorrect synthetic samples and focus the learning on informative hard samples. Evaluations on four compositional understanding benchmarks demonstrate that SVD-GT significantly improves the compositionality of VLMs, boosting the average accuracy of CLIP by over 8% across all benchmarks and outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 2% on three benchmarks. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.01167v1) | [https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat), [https://huggingface.co/SimianLuo/LCM_Dreamshaper_v7](https://huggingface.co/SimianLuo/LCM_Dreamshaper_v7) |
| Quaffure: Real-Time Quasi-Static Neural Hair Simulation | Tuur Stuyck, Gene Wei-Chin Lin, Egor Larionov, Hsiao-yu Chen, Aljaz Bozic, Nikolaos Sarafianos, Doug Roble | Realistic hair motion is crucial for high-quality avatars, but it is often limited by the computational resources available for real-time applications. To address this challenge, we propose a novel neural approach to predict physically plausible hair deformations that generalizes to various body poses, shapes, and hairstyles. Our model is trained using a self-supervised loss, eliminating the need for expensive data generation and storage. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness through numerous results across a wide range of pose and shape variations, showcasing its robust generalization capabilities and temporally smooth results. Our approach is highly suitable for real-time applications with an inference time of only a few milliseconds on consumer hardware and its ability to scale to predicting the drape of 1000 grooms in 0.3 seconds. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10061v1) | N/A |
| Learning on Model Weights using Tree Experts | Eliahu Horwitz, Bar Cavia, Jonathan Kahana, Yedid Hoshen | The increasing availability of public models begs the question: can we train neural networks that use other networks as input? Such models allow us to study different aspects of a given neural network, for example, determining the categories in a model's training dataset. However, machine learning on model weights is challenging as they often exhibit significant variation unrelated to the models' semantic properties (nuisance variation). Here, we identify a key property of real-world models: most public models belong to a small set of Model Trees, where all models within a tree are fine-tuned from a common ancestor (e.g., a foundation model). Importantly, we find that within each tree there is less nuisance variation between models. Concretely, while learning across Model Trees requires complex architectures, even a linear classifier trained on a single model layer often works within trees. While effective, these linear classifiers are computationally expensive, especially when dealing with larger models that have many parameters. To address this, we introduce Probing Experts (ProbeX), a theoretically motivated and lightweight method. Notably, ProbeX is the first probing method specifically designed to learn from the weights of a single hidden model layer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ProbeX by predicting the categories in a model's training dataset based only on its weights. Excitingly, ProbeX can also map the weights of Stable Diffusion into a shared weight-language embedding space, enabling zero-shot model classification. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.13569v2) | [https://huggingface.co/datasets/cfahlgren1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cfahlgren1), [https://huggingface.co/google/vit-](https://huggingface.co/google/vit-), [https://huggingface.co/facebook/vit-](https://huggingface.co/facebook/vit-), [https://huggingface.co/facebook/dino-](https://huggingface.co/facebook/dino-) |
| Generative Multiview Relighting for 3D Reconstruction under Extreme Illumination Variation | Hadi Alzayer, Philipp Henzler, Jonathan T. Barron, Jia-Bin Huang, Pratul P. Srinivasan, Dor Verbin | Reconstructing the geometry and appearance of objects from photographs taken in different environments is difficult as the illumination and therefore the object appearance vary across captured images. This is particularly challenging for more specular objects whose appearance strongly depends on the viewing direction. Some prior approaches model appearance variation across images using a per-image embedding vector, while others use physically-based rendering to recover the materials and per-image illumination. Such approaches fail at faithfully recovering view-dependent appearance given significant variation in input illumination and tend to produce mostly diffuse results. We present an approach that reconstructs objects from images taken under different illuminations by first relighting the images under a single reference illumination with a multiview relighting diffusion model and then reconstructing the object's geometry and appearance with a radiance field architecture that is robust to the small remaining inconsistencies among the relit images. We validate our proposed approach on both synthetic and real datasets and demonstrate that it greatly outperforms existing techniques at reconstructing high-fidelity appearance from images taken under extreme illumination variation. Moreover, our approach is particularly effective at recovering view-dependent "shiny" appearance which cannot be reconstructed by prior methods. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15211v1) | N/A |
| SAMWISE: Infusing wisdom in SAM2 for Text-Driven Video Segmentation | Claudia Cuttano, Gabriele Trivigno, Gabriele Rosi, Carlo Masone, Giuseppe Averta | Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) relies on natural language expressions to segment an object in a video clip. Existing methods restrict reasoning either to independent short clips, losing global context, or process the entire video offline, impairing their application in a streaming fashion. In this work, we aim to surpass these limitations and design an RVOS method capable of effectively operating in streaming-like scenarios while retaining contextual information from past frames. We build upon the Segment-Anything 2 (SAM2) model, that provides robust segmentation and tracking capabilities and is naturally suited for streaming processing. We make SAM2 wiser, by empowering it with natural language understanding and explicit temporal modeling at the feature extraction stage, without fine-tuning its weights, and without outsourcing modality interaction to external models. To this end, we introduce a novel adapter module that injects temporal information and multi-modal cues in the feature extraction process. We further reveal the phenomenon of tracking bias in SAM2 and propose a learnable module to adjust its tracking focus when the current frame features suggest a new object more aligned with the caption. Our proposed method, SAMWISE, achieves state-of-the-art across various benchmarks, by adding a negligible overhead of just 4.2 M parameters. The code is available at https://github.com/ClaudiaCuttano/SAMWISE | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.17646v1) | N/A |
| Continual SFT Matches Multimodal RLHF with Negative Supervision | Ke Zhu, Yu Wang, Yanpeng Sun, Qiang Chen, Jiangjiang Liu, Gang Zhang, Jingdong Wang | Multimodal RLHF usually happens after supervised finetuning (SFT) stage to continually improve vision-language models' (VLMs) comprehension. Conventional wisdom holds its superiority over continual SFT during this preference alignment stage. In this paper, we observe that the inherent value of multimodal RLHF lies in its negative supervision, the logit of the rejected responses. We thus propose a novel negative supervised finetuning (nSFT) approach that fully excavates these information resided. Our nSFT disentangles this negative supervision in RLHF paradigm, and continually aligns VLMs with a simple SFT loss. This is more memory efficient than multimodal RLHF where 2 (e.g., DPO) or 4 (e.g., PPO) large VLMs are strictly required. The effectiveness of nSFT is rigorously proved by comparing it with various multimodal RLHF approaches, across different dataset sources, base VLMs and evaluation metrics. Besides, fruitful of ablations are provided to support our hypothesis. We hope this paper will stimulate further research to properly align large vision language models. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.14797v1) | N/A |
| Three Cars Approaching within 100m! Enhancing Distant Geometry by Tri-Axis Voxel Scanning for Camera-based Semantic Scene Completion | Jongseong Bae, Junwoo Ha, Ha Young Kim | Camera-based Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is gaining attentions in the 3D perception field. However, properties such as perspective and occlusion lead to the underestimation of the geometry in distant regions, posing a critical issue for safety-focused autonomous driving systems. To tackle this, we propose ScanSSC, a novel camera-based SSC model composed of a Scan Module and Scan Loss, both designed to enhance distant scenes by leveraging context from near-viewpoint scenes. The Scan Module uses axis-wise masked attention, where each axis employing a near-to-far cascade masking that enables distant voxels to capture relationships with preceding voxels. In addition, the Scan Loss computes the cross-entropy along each axis between cumulative logits and corresponding class distributions in a near-to-far direction, thereby propagating rich context-aware signals to distant voxels. Leveraging the synergy between these components, ScanSSC achieves state-of-the-art performance, with IoUs of 44.54 and 48.29, and mIoUs of 17.40 and 20.14 on the SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16129v1) | N/A |
| 3D Gaussian Inpainting with Depth-Guided Cross-View Consistency | Sheng-Yu Huang, Zi-Ting Chou, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang | When performing 3D inpainting using novel-view rendering methods like Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) or 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), how to achieve texture and geometry consistency across camera views has been a challenge. In this paper, we propose a framework of 3D Gaussian Inpainting with Depth-Guided Cross-View Consistency (3DGIC) for cross-view consistent 3D inpainting. Guided by the rendered depth information from each training view, our 3DGIC exploits background pixels visible across different views for updating the inpainting mask, allowing us to refine the 3DGS for inpainting purposes.Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we confirm that our 3DGIC outperforms current state-of-the-art 3D inpainting methods quantitatively and qualitatively. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11801v1) | N/A |
| VidHalluc: Evaluating Temporal Hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models for Video Understanding | Chaoyu Li, Eun Woo Im, Pooyan Fazli | Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently shown significant advancements in video understanding, excelling in content reasoning and instruction-following tasks. However, the problem of hallucination, where models generate inaccurate or misleading content, remains underexplored in the video domain. Building on the observation that the visual encoder of MLLMs often struggles to differentiate between video pairs that are visually distinct but semantically similar, we introduce VidHalluc, the largest benchmark designed to examine hallucinations in MLLMs for video understanding tasks. VidHalluc assesses hallucinations across three critical dimensions: (1) action, (2) temporal sequence, and (3) scene transition. VidHalluc consists of 5,002 videos, paired based on semantic similarity and visual differences, focusing on cases where hallucinations are most likely to occur. Through comprehensive testing, our experiments show that most MLLMs are vulnerable to hallucinations across these dimensions. Furthermore, we propose DINO-HEAL, a training-free method that reduces hallucinations by incorporating spatial saliency information from DINOv2 to reweight visual features during inference. Our results demonstrate that DINO-HEAL consistently improves performance on VidHalluc, achieving an average improvement of 3.02% in mitigating hallucinations among all tasks. Both the VidHalluc benchmark and DINO-HEAL code can be accessed via $\href{https://vid-halluc.github.io/}{\text{this link}}$. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03735v1) | N/A |
| FlipSketch: Flipping Static Drawings to Text-Guided Sketch Animations | Hmrishav Bandyopadhyay, Yi-Zhe Song | Sketch animations offer a powerful medium for visual storytelling, from simple flip-book doodles to professional studio productions. While traditional animation requires teams of skilled artists to draw key frames and in-between frames, existing automation attempts still demand significant artistic effort through precise motion paths or keyframe specification. We present FlipSketch, a system that brings back the magic of flip-book animation -- just draw your idea and describe how you want it to move! Our approach harnesses motion priors from text-to-video diffusion models, adapting them to generate sketch animations through three key innovations: (i) fine-tuning for sketch-style frame generation, (ii) a reference frame mechanism that preserves visual integrity of input sketch through noise refinement, and (iii) a dual-attention composition that enables fluid motion without losing visual consistency. Unlike constrained vector animations, our raster frames support dynamic sketch transformations, capturing the expressive freedom of traditional animation. The result is an intuitive system that makes sketch animation as simple as doodling and describing, while maintaining the artistic essence of hand-drawn animation. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.10818v1) | N/A |
| A Bias-Free Training Paradigm for More General AI-generated Image Detection | Fabrizio Guillaro, Giada Zingarini, Ben Usman, Avneesh Sud, Davide Cozzolino, Luisa Verdoliva | Successful forensic detectors can produce excellent results in supervised learning benchmarks but struggle to transfer to real-world applications. We believe this limitation is largely due to inadequate training data quality. While most research focuses on developing new algorithms, less attention is given to training data selection, despite evidence that performance can be strongly impacted by spurious correlations such as content, format, or resolution. A well-designed forensic detector should detect generator specific artifacts rather than reflect data biases. To this end, we propose B-Free, a bias-free training paradigm, where fake images are generated from real ones using the conditioning procedure of stable diffusion models. This ensures semantic alignment between real and fake images, allowing any differences to stem solely from the subtle artifacts introduced by AI generation. Through content-based augmentation, we show significant improvements in both generalization and robustness over state-of-the-art detectors and more calibrated results across 27 different generative models, including recent releases, like FLUX and Stable Diffusion 3.5. Our findings emphasize the importance of a careful dataset curation, highlighting the need for further research in dataset design.

| Feature Selection for Latent Factor Models | Rittwika Kansabanik, Adrian Barbu | Feature selection is crucial for pinpointing relevant features in high-dimensional datasets, mitigating the 'curse of dimensionality,' and enhancing machine learning performance. Traditional feature selection methods for classification use data from all classes to select features for each class. This paper explores feature selection methods that select features for each class separately, using class models based on low-rank generative methods and introducing a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) feature selection criterion. This novel approach has theoretical true feature recovery guarantees under certain assumptions and is shown to outperform some existing feature selection methods on standard classification datasets. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.10128v1) | [https://github.com/openai/CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP) |
| Augmenting Multimodal LLMs with Self-Reflective Tokens for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering | Federico Cocchi, Nicholas Moratelli, Marcella Cornia, Lorenzo Baraldi, Rita Cucchiara | Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) are the natural extension of large language models to handle multimodal inputs, combining text and image data. They have recently garnered attention due to their capability to address complex tasks involving both modalities. However, their effectiveness is limited to the knowledge acquired during training, which restricts their practical utility. In this work, we introduce a novel method to enhance the adaptability of MLLMs by integrating external knowledge sources. Our proposed model, Reflective LLaVA (ReflectiVA), utilizes reflective tokens to dynamically determine the need for external knowledge and predict the relevance of information retrieved from an external database. Tokens are trained following a two-stage two-model training recipe. This ultimately enables the MLLM to manage external knowledge while preserving fluency and performance on tasks where external knowledge is not needed. Through our experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of ReflectiVA for knowledge-based visual question answering, highlighting its superior performance compared to existing methods.

| MIMO: Controllable Character Video Synthesis with Spatial Decomposed Modeling | Yifang Men, Yuan Yao, Miaomiao Cui, Liefeng Bo | Character video synthesis aims to produce realistic videos of animatable characters within lifelike scenes. As a fundamental problem in the computer vision and graphics community, 3D works typically require multi-view captures for per-case training, which severely limits their applicability of modeling arbitrary characters in a short time. Recent 2D methods break this limitation via pre-trained diffusion models, but they struggle for pose generality and scene interaction. To this end, we propose MIMO, a novel framework which can not only synthesize character videos with controllable attributes (i.e., character, motion and scene) provided by simple user inputs, but also simultaneously achieve advanced scalability to arbitrary characters, generality to novel 3D motions, and applicability to interactive real-world scenes in a unified framework. The core idea is to encode the 2D video to compact spatial codes, considering the inherent 3D nature of video occurrence. Concretely, we lift the 2D frame pixels into 3D using monocular depth estimators, and decompose the video clip to three spatial components (i.e., main human, underlying scene, and floating occlusion) in hierarchical layers based on the 3D depth. These components are further encoded to canonical identity code, structured motion code and full scene code, which are utilized as control signals of synthesis process. The design of spatial decomposed modeling enables flexible user control, complex motion expression, as well as 3D-aware synthesis for scene interactions. Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.16160v1) | [https://menyifang.github.io/projects](https://menyifang.github.io/projects) |
| Lost in Translation, Found in Context: Sign Language Translation with Contextual Cues | Youngjoon Jang, Haran Raajesh, Liliane Momeni, Gül Varol, Andrew Zisserman | Our objective is to translate continuous sign language into spoken language text. Inspired by the way human interpreters rely on context for accurate translation, we incorporate additional contextual cues together with the signing video, into a new translation framework. Specifically, besides visual sign recognition features that encode the input video, we integrate complementary textual information from (i) captions describing the background show, (ii) translation of previous sentences, as well as (iii) pseudo-glosses transcribing the signing. These are automatically extracted and inputted along with the visual features to a pre-trained large language model (LLM), which we fine-tune to generate spoken language translations in text form. Through extensive ablation studies, we show the positive contribution of each input cue to the translation performance. We train and evaluate our approach on BOBSL -- the largest British Sign Language dataset currently available. We show that our contextual approach significantly enhances the quality of the translations compared to previously reported results on BOBSL, and also to state-of-the-art methods that we implement as baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generality of our approach by applying it also to How2Sign, an American Sign Language dataset, and achieve competitive results. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09754v1) | N/A |
| Around the World in 80 Timesteps: A Generative Approach to Global Visual Geolocation | Nicolas Dufour, David Picard, Vicky Kalogeiton, Loic Landrieu | Global visual geolocation predicts where an image was captured on Earth. Since images vary in how precisely they can be localized, this task inherently involves a significant degree of ambiguity. However, existing approaches are deterministic and overlook this aspect. In this paper, we aim to close the gap between traditional geolocalization and modern generative methods. We propose the first generative geolocation approach based on diffusion and Riemannian flow matching, where the denoising process operates directly on the Earth's surface. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on three visual geolocation benchmarks: OpenStreetView-5M, YFCC-100M, and iNat21. In addition, we introduce the task of probabilistic visual geolocation, where the model predicts a probability distribution over all possible locations instead of a single point. We introduce new metrics and baselines for this task, demonstrating the advantages of our diffusion-based approach. Codes and models will be made available. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06781v1) | N/A |
| MVBoost: Boost 3D Reconstruction with Multi-View Refinement | Xiangyu Liu, Xiaomei Zhang, Zhiyuan Ma, Xiangyu Zhu, Zhen Lei | Recent advancements in 3D object reconstruction have been remarkable, yet most current 3D models rely heavily on existing 3D datasets. The scarcity of diverse 3D datasets results in limited generalization capabilities of 3D reconstruction models. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for boosting 3D reconstruction with multi-view refinement (MVBoost) by generating pseudo-GT data. The key of MVBoost is combining the advantages of the high accuracy of the multi-view generation model and the consistency of the 3D reconstruction model to create a reliable data source. Specifically, given a single-view input image, we employ a multi-view diffusion model to generate multiple views, followed by a large 3D reconstruction model to produce consistent 3D data. MVBoost then adaptively refines these multi-view images, rendered from the consistent 3D data, to build a large-scale multi-view dataset for training a feed-forward 3D reconstruction model. Additionally, the input view optimization is designed to optimize the corresponding viewpoints based on the user's input image, ensuring that the most important viewpoint is accurately tailored to the user's needs. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves superior reconstruction results and robust generalization compared to prior works. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.17772v2) | [https://github.com/Piggy-ch/MVBoost](https://github.com/Piggy-ch/MVBoost) |
| GPS as a Control Signal for Image Generation | Chao Feng, Ziyang Chen, Aleksander Holynski, Alexei A. Efros, Andrew Owens | We show that the GPS tags contained in photo metadata provide a useful control signal for image generation. We train GPS-to-image models and use them for tasks that require a fine-grained understanding of how images vary within a city. In particular, we train a diffusion model to generate images conditioned on both GPS and text. The learned model generates images that capture the distinctive appearance of different neighborhoods, parks, and landmarks. We also extract 3D models from 2D GPS-to-image models through score distillation sampling, using GPS conditioning to constrain the appearance of the reconstruction from each viewpoint. Our evaluations suggest that our GPS-conditioned models successfully learn to generate images that vary based on location, and that GPS conditioning improves estimated 3D structure. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12390v2) | [https://cfeng16.github.io/gps-gen](https://cfeng16.github.io/gps-gen) |
| SPARS3R: Semantic Prior Alignment and Regularization for Sparse 3D Reconstruction | Yutao Tang, Yuxiang Guo, Deming Li, Cheng Peng | Recent efforts in Gaussian-Splat-based Novel View Synthesis can achieve photorealistic rendering; however, such capability is limited in sparse-view scenarios due to sparse initialization and over-fitting floaters. Recent progress in depth estimation and alignment can provide dense point cloud with few views; however, the resulting pose accuracy is suboptimal. In this work, we present SPARS3R, which combines the advantages of accurate pose estimation from Structure-from-Motion and dense point cloud from depth estimation. To this end, SPARS3R first performs a Global Fusion Alignment process that maps a prior dense point cloud to a sparse point cloud from Structure-from-Motion based on triangulated correspondences. RANSAC is applied during this process to distinguish inliers and outliers. SPARS3R then performs a second, Semantic Outlier Alignment step, which extracts semantically coherent regions around the outliers and performs local alignment in these regions. Along with several improvements in the evaluation process, we demonstrate that SPARS3R can achieve photorealistic rendering with sparse images and significantly outperforms existing approaches. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.12592v1) | [https://github.com/snldmt/SPARS3R](https://github.com/snldmt/SPARS3R) |
| CRISP: Object Pose and Shape Estimation with Test-Time Adaptation | Jingnan Shi, Rajat Talak, Harry Zhang, David Jin, Luca Carlone | We consider the problem of estimating object pose and shape from an RGB-D image. Our first contribution is to introduce CRISP, a category-agnostic object pose and shape estimation pipeline. The pipeline implements an encoder-decoder model for shape estimation. It uses FiLM-conditioning for implicit shape reconstruction and a DPT-based network for estimating pose-normalized points for pose estimation. As a second contribution, we propose an optimization-based pose and shape corrector that can correct estimation errors caused by a domain gap. Observing that the shape decoder is well behaved in the convex hull of known shapes, we approximate the shape decoder with an active shape model, and show that this reduces the shape correction problem to a constrained linear least squares problem, which can be solved efficiently by an interior point algorithm. Third, we introduce a self-training pipeline to perform self-supervised domain adaptation of CRISP. The self-training is based on a correct-and-certify approach, which leverages the corrector to generate pseudo-labels at test time, and uses them to self-train CRISP. We demonstrate CRISP (and the self-training) on YCBV, SPE3R, and NOCS datasets. CRISP shows high performance on all the datasets. Moreover, our self-training is capable of bridging a large domain gap. Finally, CRISP also shows an ability to generalize to unseen objects. Code and pre-trained models will be available on https://web.mit.edu/sparklab/research/crisp_object_pose_shape/. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01052v1) | [https://github.com/libigl/libigl](https://github.com/libigl/libigl) |
| SymDPO: Boosting In-Context Learning of Large Multimodal Models with Symbol Demonstration Direct Preference Optimization | Hongrui Jia, Chaoya Jiang, Haiyang Xu, Wei Ye, Mengfan Dong, Ming Yan, Ji Zhang, Fei Huang, Shikun Zhang | As language models continue to scale, Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited emerging capabilities in In-Context Learning (ICL), enabling them to solve language tasks by prefixing a few in-context demonstrations (ICDs) as context. Inspired by these advancements, researchers have extended these techniques to develop Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with ICL capabilities. However, existing LMMs face a critical issue: they often fail to effectively leverage the visual context in multimodal demonstrations and instead simply follow textual patterns. This indicates that LMMs do not achieve effective alignment between multimodal demonstrations and model outputs. To address this problem, we propose Symbol Demonstration Direct Preference Optimization (SymDPO). Specifically, SymDPO aims to break the traditional paradigm of constructing multimodal demonstrations by using random symbols to replace text answers within instances. This forces the model to carefully understand the demonstration images and establish a relationship between the images and the symbols to answer questions correctly. We validate the effectiveness of this method on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating that with SymDPO, LMMs can more effectively understand the multimodal context within examples and utilize this knowledge to answer questions better.

| FactCheXcker: Mitigating Measurement Hallucinations in Chest X-ray Report Generation Models | Alice Heiman, Xiaoman Zhang, Emma Chen, Sung Eun Kim, Pranav Rajpurkar | Medical vision-language model models often struggle with generating accurate quantitative measurements in radiology reports, leading to hallucinations that undermine clinical reliability. We introduce FactCheXcker, a modular framework that de-hallucinates radiology report measurements by leveraging an improved query-code-update paradigm. Specifically, FactCheXcker employs specialized modules and the code generation capabilities of large language models to solve measurement queries generated based on the original report. After extracting measurable findings, the results are incorporated into an updated report. We evaluate FactCheXcker on endotracheal tube placement, which accounts for an average of 78% of report measurements, using the MIMIC-CXR dataset and 11 medical report-generation models. Our results show that FactCheXcker significantly reduces hallucinations, improves measurement precision, and maintains the quality of the original reports. Specifically, FactCheXcker improves the performance of all 11 models and achieves an average improvement of 94.0% in reducing measurement hallucinations measured by mean absolute error. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18672v1) | N/A |
| From Poses to Identity: Training-Free Person Re-Identification via Feature Centralization | Chao Yuan, Guiwei Zhang, Changxiao Ma, Tianyi Zhang, Guanglin Niu | Person re-identification (ReID) aims to extract accurate identity representation features. However, during feature extraction, individual samples are inevitably affected by noise (background, occlusions, and model limitations). Considering that features from the same identity follow a normal distribution around identity centers after training, we propose a Training-Free Feature Centralization ReID framework (Pose2ID) by aggregating the same identity features to reduce individual noise and enhance the stability of identity representation, which preserves the feature's original distribution for following strategies such as re-ranking. Specifically, to obtain samples of the same identity, we introduce two components:Identity-Guided Pedestrian Generation: by leveraging identity features to guide the generation process, we obtain high-quality images with diverse poses, ensuring identity consistency even in complex scenarios such as infrared, and occlusion.Neighbor Feature Centralization: it explores each sample's potential positive samples from its neighborhood. Experiments demonstrate that our generative model exhibits strong generalization capabilities and maintains high identity consistency. With the Feature Centralization framework, we achieve impressive performance even with an ImageNet pre-trained model without ReID training, reaching mAP/Rank-1 of 52.81/78.92 on Market1501. Moreover, our method sets new state-of-the-art results across standard, cross-modality, and occluded ReID tasks, showcasing strong adaptability. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00938v1) | [https://github.com/yuanc3/Pose2ID](https://github.com/yuanc3/Pose2ID) |
| CoCoGaussian: Leveraging Circle of Confusion for Gaussian Splatting from Defocused Images | Jungho Lee, Suhwan Cho, Taeoh Kim, Ho-Deok Jang, Minhyeok Lee, Geonho Cha, Dongyoon Wee, Dogyoon Lee, Sangyoun Lee | 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted significant attention for its high-quality novel view rendering, inspiring research to address real-world challenges. While conventional methods depend on sharp images for accurate scene reconstruction, real-world scenarios are often affected by defocus blur due to finite depth of field, making it essential to account for realistic 3D scene representation. In this study, we propose CoCoGaussian, a Circle of Confusion-aware Gaussian Splatting that enables precise 3D scene representation using only defocused images. CoCoGaussian addresses the challenge of defocus blur by modeling the Circle of Confusion (CoC) through a physically grounded approach based on the principles of photographic defocus. Exploiting 3D Gaussians, we compute the CoC diameter from depth and learnable aperture information, generating multiple Gaussians to precisely capture the CoC shape. Furthermore, we introduce a learnable scaling factor to enhance robustness and provide more flexibility in handling unreliable depth in scenes with reflective or refractive surfaces. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that CoCoGaussian achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16028v1) | [https://Jho-Yonsei.github.io/CoCoGaussian](https://Jho-Yonsei.github.io/CoCoGaussian) |
| Active Data Curation Effectively Distills Large-Scale Multimodal Models | Vishaal Udandarao, Nikhil Parthasarathy, Muhammad Ferjad Naeem, Talfan Evans, Samuel Albanie, Federico Tombari, Yongqin Xian, Alessio Tonioni, Olivier J. Hénaff | Knowledge distillation (KD) is the de facto standard for compressing large-scale models into smaller ones. Prior works have explored ever more complex KD strategies involving different objective functions, teacher-ensembles, and weight inheritance. In this work we explore an alternative, yet simple approach -- active data curation as effective distillation for contrastive multimodal pretraining. Our simple online batch selection method, ACID, outperforms strong KD baselines across various model-, data- and compute-configurations. Further, we find such an active data curation strategy to in fact be complementary to standard KD, and can be effectively combined to train highly performant inference-efficient models. Our simple and scalable pretraining framework, ACED, achieves state-of-the-art results across 27 zero-shot classification and retrieval tasks with upto 11% less inference FLOPs. We further demonstrate that our ACED models yield strong vision-encoders for training generative multimodal models in the LiT-Decoder setting, outperforming larger vision encoders for image-captioning and visual question-answering tasks. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18674v1) | N/A |
| Layered Image Vectorization via Semantic Simplification | Zhenyu Wang, Jianxi Huang, Zhida Sun, Daniel Cohen-Or, Min Lu | This work presents a novel progressive image vectorization technique aimed at generating layered vectors that represent the original image from coarse to fine detail levels. Our approach introduces semantic simplification, which combines Score Distillation Sampling and semantic segmentation to iteratively simplify the input image. Subsequently, our method optimizes the vector layers for each of the progressively simplified images. Our method provides robust optimization, which avoids local minima and enables adjustable detail levels in the final output. The layered, compact vector representation enhances usability for further editing and modification. Comparative analysis with conventional vectorization methods demonstrates our technique's superiority in producing vectors with high visual fidelity, and more importantly, maintaining vector compactness and manageability.

| BHViT: Binarized Hybrid Vision Transformer | Tian Gao, Zhiyuan Zhang, Yu Zhang, Huajun Liu, Kaijie Yin, Chengzhong Xu, Hui Kong | Model binarization has made significant progress in enabling real-time and energy-efficient computation for convolutional neural networks (CNN), offering a potential solution to the deployment challenges faced by Vision Transformers (ViTs) on edge devices. However, due to the structural differences between CNN and Transformer architectures, simply applying binary CNN strategies to the ViT models will lead to a significant performance drop. To tackle this challenge, we propose BHViT, a binarization-friendly hybrid ViT architecture and its full binarization model with the guidance of three important observations. Initially, BHViT utilizes the local information interaction and hierarchical feature aggregation technique from coarse to fine levels to address redundant computations stemming from excessive tokens. Then, a novel module based on shift operations is proposed to enhance the performance of the binary Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) module without significantly increasing computational overhead. In addition, an innovative attention matrix binarization method based on quantization decomposition is proposed to evaluate the token's importance in the binarized attention matrix. Finally, we propose a regularization loss to address the inadequate optimization caused by the incompatibility between the weight oscillation in the binary layers and the Adam Optimizer. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm achieves SOTA performance among binary ViT methods. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.02394v3) | [https://github.com/IMRL/BHViT](https://github.com/IMRL/BHViT) |
| GenVDM: Generating Vector Displacement Maps From a Single Image | Yuezhi Yang, Qimin Chen, Vladimir G. Kim, Siddhartha Chaudhuri, Qixing Huang, Zhiqin Chen | We introduce the first method for generating Vector Displacement Maps (VDMs): parameterized, detailed geometric stamps commonly used in 3D modeling. Given a single input image, our method first generates multi-view normal maps and then reconstructs a VDM from the normals via a novel reconstruction pipeline. We also propose an efficient algorithm for extracting VDMs from 3D objects, and present the first academic VDM dataset. Compared to existing 3D generative models focusing on complete shapes, we focus on generating parts that can be seamlessly attached to shape surfaces. The method gives artists rich control over adding geometric details to a 3D shape. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baselines. Generating VDMs offers additional benefits, such as using 2D image editing to customize and refine 3D details. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00605v1) | [https://github.com/mseitzer/pytorch-fid](https://github.com/mseitzer/pytorch-fid), [https://github.com/taited/clip-score](https://github.com/taited/clip-score) |
| FLAIR: VLM with Fine-grained Language-informed Image Representations | Rui Xiao, Sanghwan Kim, Mariana-Iuliana Georgescu, Zeynep Akata, Stephan Alaniz | CLIP has shown impressive results in aligning images and texts at scale. However, its ability to capture detailed visual features remains limited because CLIP matches images and texts at a global level. To address this issue, we propose FLAIR, Fine-grained Language-informed Image Representations, an approach that utilizes long and detailed image descriptions to learn localized image embeddings. By sampling diverse sub-captions that describe fine-grained details about an image, we train our vision-language model to produce not only global embeddings but also text-specific image representations. Our model introduces text-conditioned attention pooling on top of local image tokens to produce fine-grained image representations that excel at retrieving detailed image content. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on both, existing multimodal retrieval benchmarks, as well as, our newly introduced fine-grained retrieval task which evaluates vision-language models' ability to retrieve partial image content. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of FLAIR trained on 30M image-text pairs in capturing fine-grained visual information, including zero-shot semantic segmentation, outperforming models trained on billions of pairs.

| Exploring Temporally-Aware Features for Point Tracking | Inès Hyeonsu Kim, Seokju Cho, Jiahui Huang, Jung Yi, Joon-Young Lee, Seungryong Kim | Point tracking in videos is a fundamental task with applications in robotics, video editing, and more. While many vision tasks benefit from pre-trained feature backbones to improve generalizability, point tracking has primarily relied on simpler backbones trained from scratch on synthetic data, which may limit robustness in real-world scenarios. Additionally, point tracking requires temporal awareness to ensure coherence across frames, but using temporally-aware features is still underexplored. Most current methods often employ a two-stage process: an initial coarse prediction followed by a refinement stage to inject temporal information and correct errors from the coarse stage. These approach, however, is computationally expensive and potentially redundant if the feature backbone itself captures sufficient temporal information.   In this work, we introduce Chrono, a feature backbone specifically designed for point tracking with built-in temporal awareness. Leveraging pre-trained representations from self-supervised learner DINOv2 and enhanced with a temporal adapter, Chrono effectively captures long-term temporal context, enabling precise prediction even without the refinement stage. Experimental results demonstrate that Chrono achieves state-of-the-art performance in a refiner-free setting on the TAP-Vid-DAVIS and TAP-Vid-Kinetics datasets, among common feature backbones used in point tracking as well as DINOv2, with exceptional efficiency.

JanusFlow introduces a minimalist architecture that integrates autoregressive language models with rectified flow, a state-of-the-art method in generative modeling. Our key finding demonstrates that rectified flow can be straightforwardly trained within the large language model framework, eliminating the need for complex architectural modifications. To further improve the performance of our unified model, we adopt two key strategies: (i) decoupling the understanding and generation encoders, and (ii) aligning their representations during unified training. Extensive experiments show that JanusFlow achieves comparable or superior performance to specialized models in their respective domains, while significantly outperforming existing unified approaches across standard benchmarks. This work represents a step toward more efficient and versatile vision-language models. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07975v1) | [https://github.com/deepseek-ai/Janus](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/Janus), [https://huggingface.co/DeepFloyd/IF-I](https://huggingface.co/DeepFloyd/IF-I), [https://huggingface.co/datasets/echo84](https://huggingface.co/datasets/echo84), [https://huggingface.co/datasets/ProGamerGov](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ProGamerGov), [https://huggingface.co/datasets/made](https://huggingface.co/datasets/made), [https://huggingface.co/datasets/mehdidc](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mehdidc) |
| HyperGS: Hyperspectral 3D Gaussian Splatting | Christopher Thirgood, Oscar Mendez, Erin Chao Ling, Jon Storey, Simon Hadfield | We introduce HyperGS, a novel framework for Hyperspectral Novel View Synthesis (HNVS), based on a new latent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique. Our approach enables simultaneous spatial and spectral renderings by encoding material properties from multi-view 3D hyperspectral datasets. HyperGS reconstructs high-fidelity views from arbitrary perspectives with improved accuracy and speed, outperforming currently existing methods. To address the challenges of high-dimensional data, we perform view synthesis in a learned latent space, incorporating a pixel-wise adaptive density function and a pruning technique for increased training stability and efficiency. Additionally, we introduce the first HNVS benchmark, implementing a number of new baselines based on recent SOTA RGB-NVS techniques, alongside the small number of prior works on HNVS. We demonstrate HyperGS's robustness through extensive evaluation of real and simulated hyperspectral scenes with a 14db accuracy improvement upon previously published models. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.12849v1) | N/A |
| ModeSeq: Taming Sparse Multimodal Motion Prediction with Sequential Mode Modeling | Zikang Zhou, Hengjian Zhou, Haibo Hu, Zihao Wen, Jianping Wang, Yung-Hui Li, Yu-Kai Huang | Anticipating the multimodality of future events lays the foundation for safe autonomous driving. However, multimodal motion prediction for traffic agents has been clouded by the lack of multimodal ground truth. Existing works predominantly adopt the winner-take-all training strategy to tackle this challenge, yet still suffer from limited trajectory diversity and misaligned mode confidence. While some approaches address these limitations by generating excessive trajectory candidates, they necessitate a post-processing stage to identify the most representative modes, a process lacking universal principles and compromising trajectory accuracy. We are thus motivated to introduce ModeSeq, a new multimodal prediction paradigm that models modes as sequences. Unlike the common practice of decoding multiple plausible trajectories in one shot, ModeSeq requires motion decoders to infer the next mode step by step, thereby more explicitly capturing the correlation between modes and significantly enhancing the ability to reason about multimodality. Leveraging the inductive bias of sequential mode prediction, we also propose the Early-Match-Take-All (EMTA) training strategy to diversify the trajectories further. Without relying on dense mode prediction or rule-based trajectory selection, ModeSeq considerably improves the diversity of multimodal output while attaining satisfactory trajectory accuracy, resulting in balanced performance on motion prediction benchmarks. Moreover, ModeSeq naturally emerges with the capability of mode extrapolation, which supports forecasting more behavior modes when the future is highly uncertain. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.11911v1) | N/A |
| PCDreamer: Point Cloud Completion Through Multi-view Diffusion Priors | Guangshun Wei, Yuan Feng, Long Ma, Chen Wang, Yuanfeng Zhou, Changjian Li | This paper presents PCDreamer, a novel method for point cloud completion. Traditional methods typically extract features from partial point clouds to predict missing regions, but the large solution space often leads to unsatisfactory results. More recent approaches have started to use images as extra guidance, effectively improving performance, but obtaining paired data of images and partial point clouds is challenging in practice. To overcome these limitations, we harness the relatively view-consistent multi-view diffusion priors within large models, to generate novel views of the desired shape. The resulting image set encodes both global and local shape cues, which is especially beneficial for shape completion. To fully exploit the priors, we have designed a shape fusion module for producing an initial complete shape from multi-modality input (\ie, images and point clouds), and a follow-up shape consolidation module to obtain the final complete shape by discarding unreliable points introduced by the inconsistency from diffusion priors. Extensive experimental results demonstrate our superior performance, especially in recovering fine details. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.19036v1) | N/A |
| Evaluating Vision-Language Models as Evaluators in Path Planning | Mohamed Aghzal, Xiang Yue, Erion Plaku, Ziyu Yao | Despite their promise to perform complex reasoning, large language models (LLMs) have been shown to have limited effectiveness in end-to-end planning. This has inspired an intriguing question: if these models cannot plan well, can they still contribute to the planning framework as a helpful plan evaluator? In this work, we generalize this question to consider LLMs augmented with visual understanding, i.e., Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We introduce PathEval, a novel benchmark evaluating VLMs as plan evaluators in complex path-planning scenarios. Succeeding in the benchmark requires a VLM to be able to abstract traits of optimal paths from the scenario description, demonstrate precise low-level perception on each path, and integrate this information to decide the better path. Our analysis of state-of-the-art VLMs reveals that these models face significant challenges on the benchmark. We observe that the VLMs can precisely abstract given scenarios to identify the desired traits and exhibit mixed performance in integrating the provided information. Yet, their vision component presents a critical bottleneck, with models struggling to perceive low-level details about a path. Our experimental results show that this issue cannot be trivially addressed via end-to-end fine-tuning; rather, task-specific discriminative adaptation of these vision encoders is needed for these VLMs to become effective path evaluators. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18711v2) | N/A |
| Reloc3r: Large-Scale Training of Relative Camera Pose Regression for Generalizable, Fast, and Accurate Visual Localization | Siyan Dong, Shuzhe Wang, Shaohui Liu, Lulu Cai, Qingnan Fan, Juho Kannala, Yanchao Yang | Visual localization aims to determine the camera pose of a query image relative to a database of posed images. In recent years, deep neural networks that directly regress camera poses have gained popularity due to their fast inference capabilities. However, existing methods struggle to either generalize well to new scenes or provide accurate camera pose estimates. To address these issues, we present \textbf{Reloc3r}, a simple yet effective visual localization framework. It consists of an elegantly designed relative pose regression network, and a minimalist motion averaging module for absolute pose estimation. Trained on approximately 8 million posed image pairs, Reloc3r achieves surprisingly good performance and generalization ability. We conduct extensive experiments on 6 public datasets, consistently demonstrating the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. It provides high-quality camera pose estimates in real time and generalizes to novel scenes.

| TIDE: Training Locally Interpretable Domain Generalization Models Enables Test-time Correction | Aishwarya Agarwal, Srikrishna Karanam, Vineet Gandhi | We consider the problem of single-source domain generalization. Existing methods typically rely on extensive augmentations to synthetically cover diverse domains during training. However, they struggle with semantic shifts (e.g., background and viewpoint changes), as they often learn global features instead of local concepts that tend to be domain invariant. To address this gap, we propose an approach that compels models to leverage such local concepts during prediction. Given no suitable dataset with per-class concepts and localization maps exists, we first develop a novel pipeline to generate annotations by exploiting the rich features of diffusion and large-language models. Our next innovation is TIDE, a novel training scheme with a concept saliency alignment loss that ensures model focus on the right per-concept regions and a local concept contrastive loss that promotes learning domain-invariant concept representations. This not only gives a robust model but also can be visually interpreted using the predicted concept saliency maps. Given these maps at test time, our final contribution is a new correction algorithm that uses the corresponding local concept representations to iteratively refine the prediction until it aligns with prototypical concept representations that we store at the end of model training. We evaluate our approach extensively on four standard DG benchmark datasets and substantially outperform the current state-ofthe-art (12% improvement on average) while also demonstrating that our predictions can be visually interpreted | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16788v1) | N/A |
| Towards Understanding and Quantifying Uncertainty for Text-to-Image Generation | Gianni Franchi, Dat Nguyen Trong, Nacim Belkhir, Guoxuan Xia, Andrea Pilzer | Uncertainty quantification in text-to-image (T2I) generative models is crucial for understanding model behavior and improving output reliability. In this paper, we are the first to quantify and evaluate the uncertainty of T2I models with respect to the prompt. Alongside adapting existing approaches designed to measure uncertainty in the image space, we also introduce Prompt-based UNCertainty Estimation for T2I models (PUNC), a novel method leveraging Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to better address uncertainties arising from the semantics of the prompt and generated images. PUNC utilizes a LVLM to caption a generated image, and then compares the caption with the original prompt in the more semantically meaningful text space. PUNC also enables the disentanglement of both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties via precision and recall, which image-space approaches are unable to do. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PUNC outperforms state-of-the-art uncertainty estimation techniques across various settings. Uncertainty quantification in text-to-image generation models can be used on various applications including bias detection, copyright protection, and OOD detection. We also introduce a comprehensive dataset of text prompts and generation pairs to foster further research in uncertainty quantification for generative models. Our findings illustrate that PUNC not only achieves competitive performance but also enables novel applications in evaluating and improving the trustworthiness of text-to-image models. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03178v1) | N/A |
| Beyond Sight: Towards Cognitive Alignment in LVLM via Enriched Visual Knowledge | Yaqi Zhao, Yuanyang Yin, Lin Li, Mingan Lin, Victor Shea-Jay Huang, Siwei Chen, Weipeng Chen, Baoqun Yin, Zenan Zhou, Wentao Zhang | Does seeing always mean knowing? Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) integrate separately pre-trained vision and language components, often using CLIP-ViT as vision backbone. However, these models frequently encounter a core issue of "cognitive misalignment" between the vision encoder (VE) and the large language model (LLM). Specifically, the VE's representation of visual information may not fully align with LLM's cognitive framework, leading to a mismatch where visual features exceed the language model's interpretive range. To address this, we investigate how variations in VE representations influence LVLM comprehension, especially when the LLM faces VE-Unknown data-images whose ambiguous visual representations challenge the VE's interpretive precision. Accordingly, we construct a multi-granularity landmark dataset and systematically examine the impact of VE-Known and VE-Unknown data on interpretive abilities. Our results show that VE-Unknown data limits LVLM's capacity for accurate understanding, while VE-Known data, rich in distinctive features, helps reduce cognitive misalignment. Building on these insights, we propose Entity-Enhanced Cognitive Alignment (EECA), a method that employs multi-granularity supervision to generate visually enriched, well-aligned tokens that not only integrate within the LLM's embedding space but also align with the LLM's cognitive framework. This alignment markedly enhances LVLM performance in landmark recognition. Our findings underscore the challenges posed by VE-Unknown data and highlight the essential role of cognitive alignment in advancing multimodal systems. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16824v1) | N/A |
| ART: Anonymous Region Transformer for Variable Multi-Layer Transparent Image Generation | Yifan Pu, Yiming Zhao, Zhicong Tang, Ruihong Yin, Haoxing Ye, Yuhui Yuan, Dong Chen, Jianmin Bao, Sirui Zhang, Yanbin Wang, Lin Liang, Lijuan Wang, Ji Li, Xiu Li, Zhouhui Lian, Gao Huang, Baining Guo | Multi-layer image generation is a fundamental task that enables users to isolate, select, and edit specific image layers, thereby revolutionizing interactions with generative models. In this paper, we introduce the Anonymous Region Transformer (ART), which facilitates the direct generation of variable multi-layer transparent images based on a global text prompt and an anonymous region layout. Inspired by Schema theory suggests that knowledge is organized in frameworks (schemas) that enable people to interpret and learn from new information by linking it to prior knowledge.}, this anonymous region layout allows the generative model to autonomously determine which set of visual tokens should align with which text tokens, which is in contrast to the previously dominant semantic layout for the image generation task. In addition, the layer-wise region crop mechanism, which only selects the visual tokens belonging to each anonymous region, significantly reduces attention computation costs and enables the efficient generation of images with numerous distinct layers (e.g., 50+). When compared to the full attention approach, our method is over 12 times faster and exhibits fewer layer conflicts. Furthermore, we propose a high-quality multi-layer transparent image autoencoder that supports the direct encoding and decoding of the transparency of variable multi-layer images in a joint manner. By enabling precise control and scalable layer generation, ART establishes a new paradigm for interactive content creation. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.18364v1) | N/A |
| EdgeTAM: On-Device Track Anything Model | Chong Zhou, Chenchen Zhu, Yunyang Xiong, Saksham Suri, Fanyi Xiao, Lemeng Wu, Raghuraman Krishnamoorthi, Bo Dai, Chen Change Loy, Vikas Chandra, Bilge Soran | On top of Segment Anything Model (SAM), SAM 2 further extends its capability from image to video inputs through a memory bank mechanism and obtains a remarkable performance compared with previous methods, making it a foundation model for video segmentation task. In this paper, we aim at making SAM 2 much more efficient so that it even runs on mobile devices while maintaining a comparable performance. Despite several works optimizing SAM for better efficiency, we find they are not sufficient for SAM 2 because they all focus on compressing the image encoder, while our benchmark shows that the newly introduced memory attention blocks are also the latency bottleneck. Given this observation, we propose EdgeTAM, which leverages a novel 2D Spatial Perceiver to reduce the computational cost. In particular, the proposed 2D Spatial Perceiver encodes the densely stored frame-level memories with a lightweight Transformer that contains a fixed set of learnable queries. Given that video segmentation is a dense prediction task, we find preserving the spatial structure of the memories is essential so that the queries are split into global-level and patch-level groups. We also propose a distillation pipeline that further improves the performance without inference overhead. As a result, EdgeTAM achieves 87.7, 70.0, 72.3, and 71.7 J&F on DAVIS 2017, MOSE, SA-V val, and SA-V test, while running at 16 FPS on iPhone 15 Pro Max. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07256v1) | [https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2) |
| Towards Precise Scaling Laws for Video Diffusion Transformers | Yuanyang Yin, Yaqi Zhao, Mingwu Zheng, Ke Lin, Jiarong Ou, Rui Chen, Victor Shea-Jay Huang, Jiahao Wang, Xin Tao, Pengfei Wan, Di Zhang, Baoqun Yin, Wentao Zhang, Kun Gai | Achieving optimal performance of video diffusion transformers within given data and compute budget is crucial due to their high training costs. This necessitates precisely determining the optimal model size and training hyperparameters before large-scale training. While scaling laws are employed in language models to predict performance, their existence and accurate derivation in visual generation models remain underexplored. In this paper, we systematically analyze scaling laws for video diffusion transformers and confirm their presence. Moreover, we discover that, unlike language models, video diffusion models are more sensitive to learning rate and batch size, two hyperparameters often not precisely modeled. To address this, we propose a new scaling law that predicts optimal hyperparameters for any model size and compute budget. Under these optimal settings, we achieve comparable performance and reduce inference costs by 40.1% compared to conventional scaling methods, within a compute budget of 1e10 TFlops. Furthermore, we establish a more generalized and precise relationship among validation loss, any model size, and compute budget. This enables performance prediction for non-optimal model sizes, which may also be appealed under practical inference cost constraints, achieving a better trade-off. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.17470v2) | N/A |
| MaskGWM: A Generalizable Driving World Model with Video Mask Reconstruction | Jingcheng Ni, Yuxin Guo, Yichen Liu, Rui Chen, Lewei Lu, Zehuan Wu | World models that forecast environmental changes from actions are vital for autonomous driving models with strong generalization. The prevailing driving world model mainly build on video prediction model. Although these models can produce high-fidelity video sequences with advanced diffusion-based generator, they are constrained by their predictive duration and overall generalization capabilities. In this paper, we explore to solve this problem by combining generation loss with MAE-style feature-level context learning. In particular, we instantiate this target with three key design: (1) A more scalable Diffusion Transformer (DiT) structure trained with extra mask construction task. (2) we devise diffusion-related mask tokens to deal with the fuzzy relations between mask reconstruction and generative diffusion process. (3) we extend mask construction task to spatial-temporal domain by utilizing row-wise mask for shifted self-attention rather than masked self-attention in MAE. Then, we adopt a row-wise cross-view module to align with this mask design. Based on above improvement, we propose MaskGWM: a Generalizable driving World Model embodied with Video Mask reconstruction. Our model contains two variants: MaskGWM-long, focusing on long-horizon prediction, and MaskGWM-mview, dedicated to multi-view generation. Comprehensive experiments on standard benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which contain normal validation of Nuscene dataset, long-horizon rollout of OpenDV-2K dataset and zero-shot validation of Waymo dataset. Quantitative metrics on these datasets show our method notably improving state-of-the-art driving world model. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11663v1) | [https://github.com/SenseTime-FVG/OpenDWM](https://github.com/SenseTime-FVG/OpenDWM) |
| Video Depth Anything: Consistent Depth Estimation for Super-Long Videos | Sili Chen, Hengkai Guo, Shengnan Zhu, Feihu Zhang, Zilong Huang, Jiashi Feng, Bingyi Kang | Depth Anything has achieved remarkable success in monocular depth estimation with strong generalization ability. However, it suffers from temporal inconsistency in videos, hindering its practical applications. Various methods have been proposed to alleviate this issue by leveraging video generation models or introducing priors from optical flow and camera poses. Nonetheless, these methods are only applicable to short videos (< 10 seconds) and require a trade-off between quality and computational efficiency. We propose Video Depth Anything for high-quality, consistent depth estimation in super-long videos (over several minutes) without sacrificing efficiency. We base our model on Depth Anything V2 and replace its head with an efficient spatial-temporal head. We design a straightforward yet effective temporal consistency loss by constraining the temporal depth gradient, eliminating the need for additional geometric priors. The model is trained on a joint dataset of video depth and unlabeled images, similar to Depth Anything V2. Moreover, a novel key-frame-based strategy is developed for long video inference. Experiments show that our model can be applied to arbitrarily long videos without compromising quality, consistency, or generalization ability. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple video benchmarks demonstrate that our approach sets a new state-of-the-art in zero-shot video depth estimation. We offer models of different scales to support a range of scenarios, with our smallest model capable of real-time performance at 30 FPS. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12375v2) | N/A |
| Synergizing Motion and Appearance: Multi-Scale Compensatory Codebooks for Talking Head Video Generation | Shuling Zhao, Fa-Ting Hong, Xiaoshui Huang, Dan Xu | Talking head video generation aims to generate a realistic talking head video that preserves the person's identity from a source image and the motion from a driving video. Despite the promising progress made in the field, it remains a challenging and critical problem to generate videos with accurate poses and fine-grained facial details simultaneously. Essentially, facial motion is often highly complex to model precisely, and the one-shot source face image cannot provide sufficient appearance guidance during generation due to dynamic pose changes. To tackle the problem, we propose to jointly learn motion and appearance codebooks and perform multi-scale codebook compensation to effectively refine both the facial motion conditions and appearance features for talking face image decoding. Specifically, the designed multi-scale motion and appearance codebooks are learned simultaneously in a unified framework to store representative global facial motion flow and appearance patterns. Then, we present a novel multi-scale motion and appearance compensation module, which utilizes a transformer-based codebook retrieval strategy to query complementary information from the two codebooks for joint motion and appearance compensation. The entire process produces motion flows of greater flexibility and appearance features with fewer distortions across different scales, resulting in a high-quality talking head video generation framework. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach and demonstrate superior generation results from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives when compared to state-of-the-art competitors. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.00719v1) | [https://shaelynz.github.io/synergize-motion-appearance](https://shaelynz.github.io/synergize-motion-appearance) |
| Towards More General Video-based Deepfake Detection through Facial Feature Guided Adaptation for Foundation Model | Yue-Hua Han, Tai-Ming Huang, Shu-Tzu Lo, Po-Han Huang, Kai-Lung Hua, Jun-Cheng Chen | With the rise of deep learning, generative models have enabled the creation of highly realistic synthetic images, presenting challenges due to their potential misuse. While research in Deepfake detection has grown rapidly in response, many detection methods struggle with unseen Deepfakes generated by new synthesis techniques. To address this generalisation challenge, we propose a novel Deepfake detection approach by adapting the Foundation Models with rich information encoded inside, specifically using the image encoder from CLIP which has demonstrated strong zero-shot capability for downstream tasks. Inspired by the recent advances of parameter efficient fine-tuning, we propose a novel side-network-based decoder to extract spatial and temporal cues from the given video clip, with the promotion of the Facial Component Guidance (FCG) to encourage the spatial feature to include features of key facial parts for more robust and general Deepfake detection. Through extensive cross-dataset evaluations, our approach exhibits superior effectiveness in identifying unseen Deepfake samples, achieving notable performance improvement even with limited training samples and manipulation types. Our model secures an average performance enhancement of 0.9\% AUROC in cross-dataset assessments comparing with state-of-the-art methods, especially a significant lead of achieving 4.4\% improvement on the challenging DFDC dataset. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05583v2) | [https://github.com/openai/CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP), [https://github.com/1adrianb/face-alignment](https://github.com/1adrianb/face-alignment), [https://github.com/deepfakes/faceswap](https://github.com/deepfakes/faceswap), [https://github.com/MarekKowalski/FaceSwap](https://github.com/MarekKowalski/FaceSwap) |
| LiVOS: Light Video Object Segmentation with Gated Linear Matching | Qin Liu, Jianfeng Wang, Zhengyuan Yang, Linjie Li, Kevin Lin, Marc Niethammer, Lijuan Wang | Semi-supervised video object segmentation (VOS) has been largely driven by space-time memory (STM) networks, which store past frame features in a spatiotemporal memory to segment the current frame via softmax attention. However, STM networks face memory limitations due to the quadratic complexity of softmax matching, restricting their applicability as video length and resolution increase. To address this, we propose LiVOS, a lightweight memory network that employs linear matching via linear attention, reformulating memory matching into a recurrent process that reduces the quadratic attention matrix to a constant-size, spatiotemporal-agnostic 2D state. To enhance selectivity, we introduce gated linear matching, where a data-dependent gate matrix is multiplied with the state matrix to control what information to retain or discard. Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrated the effectiveness of our method. It achieved 64.8 J&F on MOSE and 85.1 J&F on DAVIS, surpassing all non-STM methods and narrowing the gap with STM-based approaches. For longer and higher-resolution videos, it matched STM-based methods with 53% less GPU memory and supports 4096p inference on a 32G consumer-grade GPU--a previously cost-prohibitive capability--opening the door for long and high-resolution video foundation models. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02818v1) | [https://github.com/uncbiag/LiVOS](https://github.com/uncbiag/LiVOS) |
| DrVideo: Document Retrieval Based Long Video Understanding | Ziyu Ma, Chenhui Gou, Hengcan Shi, Bin Sun, Shutao Li, Hamid Rezatofighi, Jianfei Cai | Most of the existing methods for video understanding primarily focus on videos only lasting tens of seconds, with limited exploration of techniques for handling long videos. The increased number of frames in long videos poses two main challenges: difficulty in locating key information and performing long-range reasoning. Thus, we propose DrVideo, a document-retrieval-based system designed for long video understanding. Our key idea is to convert the long-video understanding problem into a long-document understanding task so as to effectively leverage the power of large language models. Specifically, DrVideo first transforms a long video into a coarse text-based long document to initially retrieve key frames and then updates the documents with the augmented key frame information. It then employs an agent-based iterative loop to continuously search for missing information and augment the document until sufficient question-related information is gathered for making the final predictions in a chain-of-thought manner. Extensive experiments on long video benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our method. DrVideo significantly outperforms existing LLM-based state-of-the-art methods on EgoSchema benchmark (3 minutes), MovieChat-1K benchmark (10 minutes), and the long split of Video-MME benchmark (average of 44 minutes). | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.12846v2) | [https://llava-vl.github.io/blog](https://llava-vl.github.io/blog), [https://huggingface.co/llava-hf/llava-](https://huggingface.co/llava-hf/llava-), [https://huggingface.co/llava-hf/llava-](https://huggingface.co/llava-hf/llava-) |
| Extreme Rotation Estimation in the Wild | Hana Bezalel, Dotan Ankri, Ruojin Cai, Hadar Averbuch-Elor | We present a technique and benchmark dataset for estimating the relative 3D orientation between a pair of Internet images captured in an extreme setting, where the images have limited or non-overlapping field of views. Prior work targeting extreme rotation estimation assume constrained 3D environments and emulate perspective images by cropping regions from panoramic views. However, real images captured in the wild are highly diverse, exhibiting variation in both appearance and camera intrinsics. In this work, we propose a Transformer-based method for estimating relative rotations in extreme real-world settings, and contribute the ExtremeLandmarkPairs dataset, assembled from scene-level Internet photo collections. Our evaluation demonstrates that our approach succeeds in estimating the relative rotations in a wide variety of extreme-view Internet image pairs, outperforming various baselines, including dedicated rotation estimation techniques and contemporary 3D reconstruction methods. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07096v3) | [https://tau-vailab.github.io/ExtremeRotationsInTheWild](https://tau-vailab.github.io/ExtremeRotationsInTheWild) |
| ICT: Image-Object Cross-Level Trusted Intervention for Mitigating Object Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models | Junzhe Chen, Tianshu Zhang, Shiyu Huang, Yuwei Niu, Linfeng Zhang, Lijie Wen, Xuming Hu | Despite the recent breakthroughs achieved by Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) in understanding and responding to complex visual-textual contexts, their inherent hallucination tendencies limit their practical application in real-world scenarios that demand high levels of precision. Existing methods typically either fine-tune the LVLMs using additional data, which incurs extra costs in manual annotation and computational resources or perform comparisons at the decoding stage, which may eliminate useful language priors for reasoning while introducing inference time overhead. Therefore, we propose ICT, a lightweight, training-free method that calculates an intervention direction to shift the model's focus towards different levels of visual information, enhancing its attention to high-level and fine-grained visual details. During the forward pass stage, the intervention is applied to the attention heads that encode the overall image information and the fine-grained object details, effectively mitigating the phenomenon of overly language priors, and thereby alleviating hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ICT achieves strong performance with a small amount of data and generalizes well across different datasets and models. Our code will be public. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.15268v1) | N/A |

| Volume Tells: Dual Cycle-Consistent Diffusion for 3D Fluorescence Microscopy De-noising and Super-Resolution | Zelin Li, Chenwei Wang, Zhaoke Huang, Yiming MA, Cunmin Zhao, Zhongying Zhao, Hong Yan | 3D fluorescence microscopy is essential for understanding fundamental life processes through long-term live-cell imaging. However, due to inherent issues in imaging principles, it faces significant challenges including spatially varying noise and anisotropic resolution, where the axial resolution lags behind the lateral resolution up to 4.5 times. Meanwhile, laser power is kept low to maintain cell viability, leading to inaccessible low-noise and high-resolution paired ground truth (GT). To tackle these limitations, a dual Cycle-consistent Diffusion is proposed to effectively mine intra-volume imaging priors within 3D cell volumes in an unsupervised manner, i.e., Volume Tells (VTCD), achieving de-noising and super-resolution (SR) simultaneously. Specifically, a spatially iso-distributed denoiser is designed to exploit the noise distribution consistency between adjacent low-noise and high-noise regions within the 3D cell volume, suppressing the spatially varying noise. Then, in light of the structural consistency of the cell volume, a cross-plane global-propagation SR module propagates high-resolution details from the XY plane into adjacent regions in the XZ and YZ planes, progressively enhancing resolution across the entire 3D cell volume. Experimental results on 10 in vivo cellular dataset demonstrate high improvements in both denoising and super-resolution, with axial resolution enhanced from ~ 430 nm to ~ 90 nm. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.02261v1) | [https://github.com/temporarysharing1688/VTCD](https://github.com/temporarysharing1688/VTCD) |
| BiomedCoOp: Learning to Prompt for Biomedical Vision-Language Models | Taha Koleilat, Hojat Asgariandehkordi, Hassan Rivaz, Yiming Xiao | Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated substantial success in self-supervised representation learning for vision tasks. However, effectively adapting VLMs to downstream applications remains challenging, as their accuracy often depends on time-intensive and expertise-demanding prompt engineering, while full model fine-tuning is costly. This is particularly true for biomedical images, which, unlike natural images, typically suffer from limited annotated datasets, unintuitive image contrasts, and nuanced visual features. Recent prompt learning techniques, such as Context Optimization (CoOp) intend to tackle these issues, but still fall short in generalizability. Meanwhile, explorations in prompt learning for biomedical image analysis are still highly limited. In this work, we propose BiomedCoOp, a novel prompt learning framework that enables efficient adaptation of BiomedCLIP for accurate and highly generalizable few-shot biomedical image classification. Our approach achieves effective prompt context learning by leveraging semantic consistency with average prompt ensembles from Large Language Models (LLMs) and knowledge distillation with a statistics-based prompt selection strategy. We conducted comprehensive validation of our proposed framework on 11 medical datasets across 9 modalities and 10 organs against existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating significant improvements in both accuracy and generalizability.

| FruitNinja: 3D Object Interior Texture Generation with Gaussian Splatting | Fangyu Wu, Yuhao Chen | In the real world, objects reveal internal textures when sliced or cut, yet this behavior is not well-studied in 3D generation tasks today. For example, slicing a virtual 3D watermelon should reveal flesh and seeds. Given that no available dataset captures an object's full internal structure and collecting data from all slices is impractical, generative methods become the obvious approach. However, current 3D generation and inpainting methods often focus on visible appearance and overlook internal textures. To bridge this gap, we introduce FruitNinja, the first method to generate internal textures for 3D objects undergoing geometric and topological changes. Our approach produces objects via 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with both surface and interior textures synthesized, enabling real-time slicing and rendering without additional optimization. FruitNinja leverages a pre-trained diffusion model to progressively inpaint cross-sectional views and applies voxel-grid-based smoothing to achieve cohesive textures throughout the object. Our OpaqueAtom GS strategy overcomes 3DGS limitations by employing densely distributed opaque Gaussians, avoiding biases toward larger particles that destabilize training and sharp color transitions for fine-grained textures. Experimental results show that FruitNinja substantially outperforms existing approaches, showcasing unmatched visual quality in real-time rendered internal views across arbitrary geometry manipulations. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.12089v2) | N/A |
| From Elements to Design: A Layered Approach for Automatic Graphic Design Composition | Jiawei Lin, Shizhao Sun, Danqing Huang, Ting Liu, Ji Li, Jiang Bian | In this work, we investigate automatic design composition from multimodal graphic elements. Although recent studies have developed various generative models for graphic design, they usually face the following limitations: they only focus on certain subtasks and are far from achieving the design composition task; they do not consider the hierarchical information of graphic designs during the generation process. To tackle these issues, we introduce the layered design principle into Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and propose a novel approach, called LaDeCo, to accomplish this challenging task. Specifically, LaDeCo first performs layer planning for a given element set, dividing the input elements into different semantic layers according to their contents. Based on the planning results, it subsequently predicts element attributes that control the design composition in a layer-wise manner, and includes the rendered image of previously generated layers into the context. With this insightful design, LaDeCo decomposes the difficult task into smaller manageable steps, making the generation process smoother and clearer. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LaDeCo in design composition. Furthermore, we show that LaDeCo enables some interesting applications in graphic design, such as resolution adjustment, element filling, design variation, etc. In addition, it even outperforms the specialized models in some design subtasks without any task-specific training. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19712v1) | [https://github.com/CyberAgentAILab/OpenCOLE](https://github.com/CyberAgentAILab/OpenCOLE), [https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3), [https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-large-patch14-336MDxelF](https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-large-patch14-336MDxelF), [https://huggingface.co/cyberagent/opencole-typographylmmReferences](https://huggingface.co/cyberagent/opencole-typographylmmReferences) |
| ZoomLDM: Latent Diffusion Model for multi-scale image generation | Srikar Yellapragada, Alexandros Graikos, Kostas Triaridis, Prateek Prasanna, Rajarsi R. Gupta, Joel Saltz, Dimitris Samaras | Diffusion models have revolutionized image generation, yet several challenges restrict their application to large-image domains, such as digital pathology and satellite imagery. Given that it is infeasible to directly train a model on 'whole' images from domains with potential gigapixel sizes, diffusion-based generative methods have focused on synthesizing small, fixed-size patches extracted from these images. However, generating small patches has limited applicability since patch-based models fail to capture the global structures and wider context of large images, which can be crucial for synthesizing (semantically) accurate samples. In this paper, to overcome this limitation, we present ZoomLDM, a diffusion model tailored for generating images across multiple scales. Central to our approach is a novel magnification-aware conditioning mechanism that utilizes self-supervised learning (SSL) embeddings and allows the diffusion model to synthesize images at different 'zoom' levels, i.e., fixed-size patches extracted from large images at varying scales. ZoomLDM achieves state-of-the-art image generation quality across all scales, excelling particularly in the data-scarce setting of generating thumbnails of entire large images. The multi-scale nature of ZoomLDM unlocks additional capabilities in large image generation, enabling computationally tractable and globally coherent image synthesis up to $4096 \times 4096$ pixels and $4\times$ super-resolution. Additionally, multi-scale features extracted from ZoomLDM are highly effective in multiple instance learning experiments. We provide high-resolution examples of the generated images on our website https://histodiffusion.github.io/docs/publications/zoomldm/. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16969v1) | [https://github.com/mseitzer/pytorch-fid](https://github.com/mseitzer/pytorch-fid) |
| UltraFusion: Ultra High Dynamic Imaging using Exposure Fusion | Zixuan Chen, Yujin Wang, Xin Cai, Zhiyuan You, Zheming Lu, Fan Zhang, Shi Guo, Tianfan Xue | Capturing high dynamic range (HDR) scenes is one of the most important issues in camera design. Majority of cameras use exposure fusion technique, which fuses images captured by different exposure levels, to increase dynamic range. However, this approach can only handle images with limited exposure difference, normally 3-4 stops. When applying to very high dynamic scenes where a large exposure difference is required, this approach often fails due to incorrect alignment or inconsistent lighting between inputs, or tone mapping artifacts. In this work, we propose UltraFusion, the first exposure fusion technique that can merge input with 9 stops differences. The key idea is that we model the exposure fusion as a guided inpainting problem, where the under-exposed image is used as a guidance to fill the missing information of over-exposed highlight in the over-exposed region. Using under-exposed image as a soft guidance, instead of a hard constrain, our model is robust to potential alignment issue or lighting variations. Moreover, utilizing the image prior of the generative model, our model also generates natural tone mapping, even for very high-dynamic range scene. Our approach outperforms HDR-Transformer on latest HDR benchmarks. Moreover, to test its performance in ultra high dynamic range scene, we capture a new real-world exposure fusion benchmark, UltraFusion Dataset, with exposure difference up to 9 stops, and experiments show that \model~can generate beautiful and high-quality fusion results under various scenarios.

| ReCapture: Generative Video Camera Controls for User-Provided Videos using Masked Video Fine-Tuning | David Junhao Zhang, Roni Paiss, Shiran Zada, Nikhil Karnad, David E. Jacobs, Yael Pritch, Inbar Mosseri, Mike Zheng Shou, Neal Wadhwa, Nataniel Ruiz | Recently, breakthroughs in video modeling have allowed for controllable camera trajectories in generated videos. However, these methods cannot be directly applied to user-provided videos that are not generated by a video model. In this paper, we present ReCapture, a method for generating new videos with novel camera trajectories from a single user-provided video. Our method allows us to re-generate the reference video, with all its existing scene motion, from vastly different angles and with cinematic camera motion. Notably, using our method we can also plausibly hallucinate parts of the scene that were not observable in the reference video. Our method works by (1) generating a noisy anchor video with a new camera trajectory using multiview diffusion models or depth-based point cloud rendering and then (2) regenerating the anchor video into a clean and temporally consistent reangled video using our proposed masked video fine-tuning technique. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.05003v1) | N/A |
| Adversarial Diffusion Compression for Real-World Image Super-Resolution | Bin Chen, Gehui Li, Rongyuan Wu, Xindong Zhang, Jie Chen, Jian Zhang, Lei Zhang | Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) aims to reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs degraded by complex, unknown processes. While many Stable Diffusion (SD)-based Real-ISR methods have achieved remarkable success, their slow, multi-step inference hinders practical deployment. Recent SD-based one-step networks like OSEDiff and S3Diff alleviate this issue but still incur high computational costs due to their reliance on large pretrained SD models. This paper proposes a novel Real-ISR method, AdcSR, by distilling the one-step diffusion network OSEDiff into a streamlined diffusion-GAN model under our Adversarial Diffusion Compression (ADC) framework. We meticulously examine the modules of OSEDiff, categorizing them into two types: (1) Removable (VAE encoder, prompt extractor, text encoder, etc.) and (2) Prunable (denoising UNet and VAE decoder). Since direct removal and pruning can degrade the model's generation capability, we pretrain our pruned VAE decoder to restore its ability to decode images and employ adversarial distillation to compensate for performance loss. This ADC-based diffusion-GAN hybrid design effectively reduces complexity by 73% in inference time, 78% in computation, and 74% in parameters, while preserving the model's generation capability. Experiments manifest that our proposed AdcSR achieves competitive recovery quality on both synthetic and real-world datasets, offering up to 9.3$\times$ speedup over previous one-step diffusion-based methods. Code and models will be made available. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.13383v1) | N/A |
| Show and Tell: Visually Explainable Deep Neural Nets via Spatially-Aware Concept Bottleneck Models | Itay Benou, Tammy Riklin-Raviv | Modern deep neural networks have now reached human-level performance across a variety of tasks. However, unlike humans they lack the ability to explain their decisions by showing where and telling what concepts guided them. In this work, we present a unified framework for transforming any vision neural network into a spatially and conceptually interpretable model. We introduce a spatially-aware concept bottleneck layer that projects "black-box" features of pre-trained backbone models into interpretable concept maps, without requiring human labels. By training a classification layer over this bottleneck, we obtain a self-explaining model that articulates which concepts most influenced its prediction, along with heatmaps that ground them in the input image. Accordingly, we name this method "Spatially-Aware and Label-Free Concept Bottleneck Model" (SALF-CBM). Our results show that the proposed SALF-CBM: (1) Outperforms non-spatial CBM methods, as well as the original backbone, on a variety of classification tasks; (2) Produces high-quality spatial explanations, outperforming widely used heatmap-based methods on a zero-shot segmentation task; (3) Facilitates model exploration and debugging, enabling users to query specific image regions and refine the model's decisions by locally editing its concept maps. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.20134v1) | N/A |
| Distilled Prompt Learning for Incomplete Multimodal Survival Prediction | Yingxue Xu, Fengtao Zhou, Chenyu Zhao, Yihui Wang, Can Yang, Hao Chen | The integration of multimodal data including pathology images and gene profiles is widely applied in precise survival prediction. Despite recent advances in multimodal survival models, collecting complete modalities for multimodal fusion still poses a significant challenge, hindering their application in clinical settings. Current approaches tackling incomplete modalities often fall short, as they typically compensate for only a limited part of the knowledge of missing modalities. To address this issue, we propose a Distilled Prompt Learning framework (DisPro) to utilize the strong robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) to missing modalities, which employs two-stage prompting for compensation of comprehensive information for missing modalities. In the first stage, Unimodal Prompting (UniPro) distills the knowledge distribution of each modality, preparing for supplementing modality-specific knowledge of the missing modality in the subsequent stage. In the second stage, Multimodal Prompting (MultiPro) leverages available modalities as prompts for LLMs to infer the missing modality, which provides modality-common information. Simultaneously, the unimodal knowledge acquired in the first stage is injected into multimodal inference to compensate for the modality-specific knowledge of the missing modality. Extensive experiments covering various missing scenarios demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method.

| Robust 3D Shape Reconstruction in Zero-Shot from a Single Image in the Wild | Junhyeong Cho, Kim Youwang, Hunmin Yang, Tae-Hyun Oh | Recent monocular 3D shape reconstruction methods have shown promising zero-shot results on object-segmented images without any occlusions. However, their effectiveness is significantly compromised in real-world conditions, due to imperfect object segmentation by off-the-shelf models and the prevalence of occlusions. To effectively address these issues, we propose a unified regression model that integrates segmentation and reconstruction, specifically designed for occlusion-aware 3D shape reconstruction. To facilitate its reconstruction in the wild, we also introduce a scalable data synthesis pipeline that simulates a wide range of variations in objects, occluders, and backgrounds. Training on our synthetic data enables the proposed model to achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot results on real-world images, using significantly fewer parameters than competing approaches. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.14539v2) | N/A |
| Mimir: Improving Video Diffusion Models for Precise Text Understanding | Shuai Tan, Biao Gong, Yutong Feng, Kecheng Zheng, Dandan Zheng, Shuwei Shi, Yujun Shen, Jingdong Chen, Ming Yang | Text serves as the key control signal in video generation due to its narrative nature. To render text descriptions into video clips, current video diffusion models borrow features from text encoders yet struggle with limited text comprehension. The recent success of large language models (LLMs) showcases the power of decoder-only transformers, which offers three clear benefits for text-to-video (T2V) generation, namely, precise text understanding resulting from the superior scalability, imagination beyond the input text enabled by next token prediction, and flexibility to prioritize user interests through instruction tuning. Nevertheless, the feature distribution gap emerging from the two different text modeling paradigms hinders the direct use of LLMs in established T2V models. This work addresses this challenge with Mimir, an end-to-end training framework featuring a carefully tailored token fuser to harmonize the outputs from text encoders and LLMs. Such a design allows the T2V model to fully leverage learned video priors while capitalizing on the text-related capability of LLMs. Extensive quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of Mimir in generating high-quality videos with excellent text comprehension, especially when processing short captions and managing shifting motions.

| CADRef: Robust Out-of-Distribution Detection via Class-Aware Decoupled Relative Feature Leveraging | Zhiwei Ling, Yachen Chang, Hailiang Zhao, Xinkui Zhao, Kingsum Chow, Shuiguang Deng | Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely criticized for their overconfidence when dealing with out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, highlighting the critical need for effective OOD detection to ensure the safe deployment of DNNs in real-world settings. Existing post-hoc OOD detection methods primarily enhance the discriminative power of logit-based approaches by reshaping sample features, yet they often neglect critical information inherent in the features themselves. In this paper, we propose the Class-Aware Relative Feature-based method (CARef), which utilizes the error between a sample's feature and its class-aware average feature as a discriminative criterion. To further refine this approach, we introduce the Class-Aware Decoupled Relative Feature-based method (CADRef), which decouples sample features based on the alignment of signs between the relative feature and corresponding model weights, enhancing the discriminative capabilities of CARef. Extensive experimental results across multiple datasets and models demonstrate that both proposed methods exhibit effectiveness and robustness in OOD detection compared to state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, our two methods outperform the best baseline by 2.82% and 3.27% in AUROC, with improvements of 4.03% and 6.32% in FPR95, respectively. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00325v1) | N/A |
| Stretching Each Dollar: Diffusion Training from Scratch on a Micro-Budget | Vikash Sehwag, Xianghao Kong, Jingtao Li, Michael Spranger, Lingjuan Lyu | As scaling laws in generative AI push performance, they also simultaneously concentrate the development of these models among actors with large computational resources. With a focus on text-to-image (T2I) generative models, we aim to address this bottleneck by demonstrating very low-cost training of large-scale T2I diffusion transformer models. As the computational cost of transformers increases with the number of patches in each image, we propose to randomly mask up to 75% of the image patches during training. We propose a deferred masking strategy that preprocesses all patches using a patch-mixer before masking, thus significantly reducing the performance degradation with masking, making it superior to model downscaling in reducing computational cost. We also incorporate the latest improvements in transformer architecture, such as the use of mixture-of-experts layers, to improve performance and further identify the critical benefit of using synthetic images in micro-budget training. Finally, using only 37M publicly available real and synthetic images, we train a 1.16 billion parameter sparse transformer with only \$1,890 economical cost and achieve a 12.7 FID in zero-shot generation on the COCO dataset. Notably, our model achieves competitive FID and high-quality generations while incurring 118$\times$ lower cost than stable diffusion models and 14$\times$ lower cost than the current state-of-the-art approach that costs \$28,400. We aim to release our end-to-end training pipeline to further democratize the training of large-scale diffusion models on micro-budgets. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15811v1) | [https://github.com/SonyResearch/micro_diffusion](https://github.com/SonyResearch/micro_diffusion), [https://github.com/kakaobrain/coyo-dataset](https://github.com/kakaobrain/coyo-dataset), [https://github.com/kakaobrain/minDALL-E](https://github.com/kakaobrain/minDALL-E), [https://github.com/mosaicml/streaming](https://github.com/mosaicml/streaming), [https://github.com/NVIDIA/TransformerEngine](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TransformerEngine), [https://github.com/GaParmar/clean-fid](https://github.com/GaParmar/clean-fid), [https://huggingface.co/apple/DFN5B-CLIP-ViT-H-14-378](https://huggingface.co/apple/DFN5B-CLIP-ViT-H-14-378), [https://huggingface.co/DeepFloyd/t5-v1_1-xxl](https://huggingface.co/DeepFloyd/t5-v1_1-xxl), [https://huggingface.co/apple/DFN5B-CLIP-ViT-H-14-378](https://huggingface.co/apple/DFN5B-CLIP-ViT-H-14-378) |
| A Flag Decomposition for Hierarchical Datasets | Nathan Mankovich, Ignacio Santamaria, Gustau Camps-Valls, Tolga Birdal | Flag manifolds encode hierarchical nested sequences of subspaces and serve as powerful structures for various computer vision and machine learning applications. Despite their utility in tasks such as dimensionality reduction, motion averaging, and subspace clustering, current applications are often restricted to extracting flags using common matrix decomposition methods like the singular value decomposition. Here, we address the need for a general algorithm to factorize and work with hierarchical datasets. In particular, we propose a novel, flag-based method that decomposes arbitrary hierarchical real-valued data into a hierarchy-preserving flag representation in Stiefel coordinates. Our work harnesses the potential of flag manifolds in applications including denoising, clustering, and few-shot learning. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07782v1) | [https://github.com/nmank/FD](https://github.com/nmank/FD) |
| Towards Lossless Implicit Neural Representation via Bit Plane Decomposition | Woo Kyoung Han, Byeonghun Lee, Hyunmin Cho, Sunghoon Im, Kyong Hwan Jin | We quantify the upper bound on the size of the implicit neural representation (INR) model from a digital perspective. The upper bound of the model size increases exponentially as the required bit-precision increases. To this end, we present a bit-plane decomposition method that makes INR predict bit-planes, producing the same effect as reducing the upper bound of the model size. We validate our hypothesis that reducing the upper bound leads to faster convergence with constant model size. Our method achieves lossless representation in 2D image and audio fitting, even for high bit-depth signals, such as 16-bit, which was previously unachievable. We pioneered the presence of bit bias, which INR prioritizes as the most significant bit (MSB). We expand the application of the INR task to bit depth expansion, lossless image compression, and extreme network quantization.

| AnyAttack: Targeted Adversarial Attacks on Vision-Language Models toward Any Images | Jiaming Zhang, Junhong Ye, Xingjun Ma, Yige Li, Yunfan Yang, Jitao Sang, Dit-Yan Yeung | Due to their multimodal capabilities, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have found numerous impactful applications in real-world scenarios. However, recent studies have revealed that VLMs are vulnerable to image-based adversarial attacks, particularly targeted adversarial images that manipulate the model to generate harmful content specified by the adversary. Current attack methods rely on predefined target labels to create targeted adversarial attacks, which limits their scalability and applicability for large-scale robustness evaluations. In this paper, we propose AnyAttack, a self-supervised framework that generates targeted adversarial images for VLMs without label supervision, allowing any image to serve as a target for the attack. Our framework employs the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm, with the adversarial noise generator pre-trained on the large-scale LAION-400M dataset. This large-scale pre-training endows our method with powerful transferability across a wide range of VLMs. Extensive experiments on five mainstream open-source VLMs (CLIP, BLIP, BLIP2, InstructBLIP, and MiniGPT-4) across three multimodal tasks (image-text retrieval, multimodal classification, and image captioning) demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack. Additionally, we successfully transfer AnyAttack to multiple commercial VLMs, including Google Gemini, Claude Sonnet, Microsoft Copilot and OpenAI GPT. These results reveal an unprecedented risk to VLMs, highlighting the need for effective countermeasures. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05346v2) | [https://github.com/jiamingzhang94/AnyAttack](https://github.com/jiamingzhang94/AnyAttack) |
| NoPain: No-box Point Cloud Attack via Optimal Transport Singular Boundary | Zezeng Li, Xiaoyu Du, Na Lei, Liming Chen, Weimin Wang | Adversarial attacks exploit the vulnerability of deep models against adversarial samples. Existing point cloud attackers are tailored to specific models, iteratively optimizing perturbations based on gradients in either a white-box or black-box setting. Despite their promising attack performance, they often struggle to produce transferable adversarial samples due to overfitting the specific parameters of surrogate models. To overcome this issue, we shift our focus to the data distribution itself and introduce a novel approach named NoPain, which employs optimal transport (OT) to identify the inherent singular boundaries of the data manifold for cross-network point cloud attacks. Specifically, we first calculate the OT mapping from noise to the target feature space, then identify singular boundaries by locating non-differentiable positions. Finally, we sample along singular boundaries to generate adversarial point clouds. Once the singular boundaries are determined, NoPain can efficiently produce adversarial samples without the need of iterative updates or guidance from the surrogate classifiers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed end-to-end method outperforms baseline approaches in terms of both transferability and efficiency, while also maintaining notable advantages even against defense strategies. The source code will be publicly available. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00063v2) | N/A |
| ControlFace: Harnessing Facial Parametric Control for Face Rigging | Wooseok Jang, Youngjun Hong, Geonho Cha, Seungryong Kim | Manipulation of facial images to meet specific controls such as pose, expression, and lighting, also known as face rigging, is a complex task in computer vision. Existing methods are limited by their reliance on image datasets, which necessitates individual-specific fine-tuning and limits their ability to retain fine-grained identity and semantic details, reducing practical usability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ControlFace, a novel face rigging method conditioned on 3DMM renderings that enables flexible, high-fidelity control. We employ a dual-branch U-Nets: one, referred to as FaceNet, captures identity and fine details, while the other focuses on generation. To enhance control precision, the control mixer module encodes the correlated features between the target-aligned control and reference-aligned control, and a novel guidance method, reference control guidance, steers the generation process for better control adherence. By training on a facial video dataset, we fully utilize FaceNet's rich representations while ensuring control adherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate ControlFace's superior performance in identity preservation and control precision, highlighting its practicality.

| Towards RAW Object Detection in Diverse Conditions | Zhong-Yu Li, Xin Jin, Boyuan Sun, Chun-Le Guo, Ming-Ming Cheng | Existing object detection methods often consider sRGB input, which was compressed from RAW data using ISP originally designed for visualization. However, such compression might lose crucial information for detection, especially under complex light and weather conditions. We introduce the AODRaw dataset, which offers 7,785 high-resolution real RAW images with 135,601 annotated instances spanning 62 categories, capturing a broad range of indoor and outdoor scenes under 9 distinct light and weather conditions. Based on AODRaw that supports RAW and sRGB object detection, we provide a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating current detection methods. We find that sRGB pre-training constrains the potential of RAW object detection due to the domain gap between sRGB and RAW, prompting us to directly pre-train on the RAW domain. However, it is harder for RAW pre-training to learn rich representations than sRGB pre-training due to the camera noise. To assist RAW pre-training, we distill the knowledge from an off-the-shelf model pre-trained on the sRGB domain. As a result, we achieve substantial improvements under diverse and adverse conditions without relying on extra pre-processing modules. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/lzyhha/AODRaw. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.15678v1) | [https://github.com/lzyhha/AODRaw](https://github.com/lzyhha/AODRaw) |
| VideoAutoArena: An Automated Arena for Evaluating Large Multimodal Models in Video Analysis through User Simulation | Ziyang Luo, Haoning Wu, Dongxu Li, Jing Ma, Mohan Kankanhalli, Junnan Li | Large multimodal models (LMMs) with advanced video analysis capabilities have recently garnered significant attention. However, most evaluations rely on traditional methods like multiple-choice questions in benchmarks such as VideoMME and LongVideoBench, which are prone to lack the depth needed to capture the complex demands of real-world users. To address this limitation-and due to the prohibitive cost and slow pace of human annotation for video tasks-we introduce VideoAutoArena, an arena-style benchmark inspired by LMSYS Chatbot Arena's framework, designed to automatically assess LMMs' video analysis abilities. VideoAutoArena utilizes user simulation to generate open-ended, adaptive questions that rigorously assess model performance in video understanding. The benchmark features an automated, scalable evaluation framework, incorporating a modified ELO Rating System for fair and continuous comparisons across multiple LMMs. To validate our automated judging system, we construct a 'gold standard' using a carefully curated subset of human annotations, demonstrating that our arena strongly aligns with human judgment while maintaining scalability. Additionally, we introduce a fault-driven evolution strategy, progressively increasing question complexity to push models toward handling more challenging video analysis scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that VideoAutoArena effectively differentiates among state-of-the-art LMMs, providing insights into model strengths and areas for improvement. To further streamline our evaluation, we introduce VideoAutoBench as an auxiliary benchmark, where human annotators label winners in a subset of VideoAutoArena battles. We use GPT-4o as a judge to compare responses against these human-validated answers. Together, VideoAutoArena and VideoAutoBench offer a cost-effective, and scalable framework for evaluating LMMs in user-centric video analysis. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.13281v1) | N/A |
| From Alexnet to Transformers: Measuring the Non-linearity of Deep Neural Networks with Affine Optimal Transport | Quentin Bouniot, Ievgen Redko, Anton Mallasto, Charlotte Laclau, Karol Arndt, Oliver Struckmeier, Markus Heinonen, Ville Kyrki, Samuel Kaski | In the last decade, we have witnessed the introduction of several novel deep neural network (DNN) architectures exhibiting ever-increasing performance across diverse tasks. Explaining the upward trend of their performance, however, remains difficult as different DNN architectures of comparable depth and width -- common factors associated with their expressive power -- may exhibit a drastically different performance even when trained on the same dataset. In this paper, we introduce the concept of the non-linearity signature of DNN, the first theoretically sound solution for approximately measuring the non-linearity of deep neural networks. Built upon a score derived from closed-form optimal transport mappings, this signature provides a better understanding of the inner workings of a wide range of DNN architectures and learning paradigms, with a particular emphasis on the computer vision task. We provide extensive experimental results that highlight the practical usefulness of the proposed non-linearity signature and its potential for long-reaching implications.

| ChatGarment: Garment Estimation, Generation and Editing via Large Language Models | Siyuan Bian, Chenghao Xu, Yuliang Xiu, Artur Grigorev, Zhen Liu, Cewu Lu, Michael J. Black, Yao Feng | We introduce ChatGarment, a novel approach that leverages large vision-language models (VLMs) to automate the estimation, generation, and editing of 3D garments from images or text descriptions. Unlike previous methods that struggle in real-world scenarios or lack interactive editing capabilities, ChatGarment can estimate sewing patterns from in-the-wild images or sketches, generate them from text descriptions, and edit garments based on user instructions, all within an interactive dialogue. These sewing patterns can then be draped into 3D garments, which are easily animatable and simulatable. This is achieved by finetuning a VLM to directly generate a JSON file that includes both textual descriptions of garment types and styles, as well as continuous numerical attributes. This JSON file is then used to create sewing patterns through a programming parametric model. To support this, we refine the existing programming model, GarmentCode, by expanding its garment type coverage and simplifying its structure for efficient VLM fine-tuning. Additionally, we construct a large-scale dataset of image-to-sewing-pattern and text-to-sewing-pattern pairs through an automated data pipeline. Extensive evaluations demonstrate ChatGarment's ability to accurately reconstruct, generate, and edit garments from multimodal inputs, highlighting its potential to revolutionize workflows in fashion and gaming applications. Code and data will be available at https://chatgarment.github.io/. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17811v2) | N/A |
| What Makes a Good Dataset for Knowledge Distillation? | Logan Frank, Jim Davis | Knowledge distillation (KD) has been a popular and effective method for model compression. One important assumption of KD is that the teacher's original dataset will also be available when training the student. However, in situations such as continual learning and distilling large models trained on company-withheld datasets, having access to the original data may not always be possible. This leads practitioners towards utilizing other sources of supplemental data, which could yield mixed results. One must then ask: "what makes a good dataset for transferring knowledge from teacher to student?" Many would assume that only real in-domain imagery is viable, but is that the only option? In this work, we explore multiple possible surrogate distillation datasets and demonstrate that many different datasets, even unnatural synthetic imagery, can serve as a suitable alternative in KD. From examining these alternative datasets, we identify and present various criteria describing what makes a good dataset for distillation. Source code will be available in the future. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.12817v1) | N/A |
| Towards Long-Horizon Vision-Language Navigation: Platform, Benchmark and Method | Xinshuai Song, Weixing Chen, Yang Liu, Vincent Chan, Guanbin Li, Liang Lin | Existing Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) methods primarily focus on single-stage navigation, limiting their effectiveness in multi-stage and long-horizon tasks within complex and dynamic environments. To address these limitations, we propose a novel VLN task, named Long-Horizon Vision-Language Navigation (LH-VLN), which emphasizes long-term planning and decision consistency across consecutive subtasks. Furthermore, to support LH-VLN, we develop an automated data generation platform NavGen, which constructs datasets with complex task structures and improves data utility through a bidirectional, multi-granularity generation approach. To accurately evaluate complex tasks, we construct the Long-Horizon Planning and Reasoning in VLN (LHPR-VLN) benchmark consisting of 3,260 tasks with an average of 150 task steps, serving as the first dataset specifically designed for the long-horizon vision-language navigation task. Furthermore, we propose Independent Success Rate (ISR), Conditional Success Rate (CSR), and CSR weight by Ground Truth (CGT) metrics, to provide fine-grained assessments of task completion. To improve model adaptability in complex tasks, we propose a novel Multi-Granularity Dynamic Memory (MGDM) module that integrates short-term memory blurring with long-term memory retrieval to enable flexible navigation in dynamic environments. Our platform, benchmark and method supply LH-VLN with a robust data generation pipeline, comprehensive model evaluation dataset, reasonable metrics, and a novel VLN model, establishing a foundational framework for advancing LH-VLN. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.09082v2) | [https://hcplab-sysu.github.io/LH-VLN](https://hcplab-sysu.github.io/LH-VLN) |
| Seeking Consistent Flat Minima for Better Domain Generalization via Refining Loss Landscapes | Aodi Li, Liansheng Zhuang, Xiao Long, Minghong Yao, Shafei Wang | Domain generalization aims to learn a model from multiple training domains and generalize it to unseen test domains. Recent theory has shown that seeking the deep models, whose parameters lie in the flat minima of the loss landscape, can significantly reduce the out-of-domain generalization error. However, existing methods often neglect the consistency of loss landscapes in different domains, resulting in models that are not simultaneously in the optimal flat minima in all domains, which limits their generalization ability. To address this issue, this paper proposes an iterative Self-Feedback Training (SFT) framework to seek consistent flat minima that are shared across different domains by progressively refining loss landscapes during training. It alternatively generates a feedback signal by measuring the inconsistency of loss landscapes in different domains and refines these loss landscapes for greater consistency using this feedback signal. Benefiting from the consistency of the flat minima within these refined loss landscapes, our SFT helps achieve better out-of-domain generalization. Extensive experiments on DomainBed demonstrate superior performances of SFT when compared to state-of-the-art sharpness-aware methods and other prevalent DG baselines. On average across five DG benchmarks, SFT surpasses the sharpness-aware minimization by 2.6% with ResNet-50 and 1.5% with ViT-B/16, respectively. The code will be available soon. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.13573v1) | N/A |
| TAPT: Test-Time Adversarial Prompt Tuning for Robust Inference in Vision-Language Models | Xin Wang, Kai Chen, Jiaming Zhang, Jingjing Chen, Xingjun Ma | Large pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated excellent zero-shot generalizability across various downstream tasks. However, recent studies have shown that the inference performance of CLIP can be greatly degraded by small adversarial perturbations, especially its visual modality, posing significant safety threats. To mitigate this vulnerability, in this paper, we propose a novel defense method called Test-Time Adversarial Prompt Tuning (TAPT) to enhance the inference robustness of CLIP against visual adversarial attacks. TAPT is a test-time defense method that learns defensive bimodal (textual and visual) prompts to robustify the inference process of CLIP. Specifically, it is an unsupervised method that optimizes the defensive prompts for each test sample by minimizing a multi-view entropy and aligning adversarial-clean distributions. We evaluate the effectiveness of TAPT on 11 benchmark datasets, including ImageNet and 10 other zero-shot datasets, demonstrating that it enhances the zero-shot adversarial robustness of the original CLIP by at least 48.9% against AutoAttack (AA), while largely maintaining performance on clean examples. Moreover, TAPT outperforms existing adversarial prompt tuning methods across various backbones, achieving an average robustness improvement of at least 36.6%. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.13136v1) | N/A |
| Event fields: Capturing light fields at high speed, resolution, and dynamic range | Ziyuan Qu, Zihao Zou, Vivek Boominathan, Praneeth Chakravarthula, Adithya Pediredla | Event cameras, which feature pixels that independently respond to changes in brightness, are becoming increasingly popular in high-speed applications due to their lower latency, reduced bandwidth requirements, and enhanced dynamic range compared to traditional frame-based cameras. Numerous imaging and vision techniques have leveraged event cameras for high-speed scene understanding by capturing high-framerate, high-dynamic range videos, primarily utilizing the temporal advantages inherent to event cameras. Additionally, imaging and vision techniques have utilized the light field-a complementary dimension to temporal information-for enhanced scene understanding. In this work, we propose "Event Fields", a new approach that utilizes innovative optical designs for event cameras to capture light fields at high speed. We develop the underlying mathematical framework for Event Fields and introduce two foundational frameworks to capture them practically: spatial multiplexing to capture temporal derivatives and temporal multiplexing to capture angular derivatives. To realize these, we design two complementary optical setups one using a kaleidoscope for spatial multiplexing and another using a galvanometer for temporal multiplexing. We evaluate the performance of both designs using a custom-built simulator and real hardware prototypes, showcasing their distinct benefits. Our event fields unlock the full advantages of typical light fields-like post-capture refocusing and depth estimation-now supercharged for high-speed and high-dynamic range scenes. This novel light-sensing paradigm opens doors to new applications in photography, robotics, and AR/VR, and presents fresh challenges in rendering and machine learning. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06191v1) | N/A |
| A Unified Framework for Heterogeneous Semi-supervised Learning | Marzi Heidari, Abdullah Alchihabi, Hao Yan, Yuhong Guo | In this work, we introduce a novel problem setup termed as Heterogeneous Semi-Supervised Learning (HSSL), which presents unique challenges by bridging the semi-supervised learning (SSL) task and the unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) task, and expanding standard semi-supervised learning to cope with heterogeneous training data. At its core, HSSL aims to learn a prediction model using a combination of labeled and unlabeled training data drawn separately from heterogeneous domains that share a common set of semantic categories; this model is intended to differentiate the semantic categories of test instances sampled from both the labeled and unlabeled domains. In particular, the labeled and unlabeled domains have dissimilar label distributions and class feature distributions. This heterogeneity, coupled with the assorted sources of the test data, introduces significant challenges to standard SSL and UDA methods. Therefore, we propose a novel method, Unified Framework for Heterogeneous Semi-supervised Learning (Uni-HSSL), to address HSSL by directly learning a fine-grained classifier from the heterogeneous data, which adaptively handles the inter-domain heterogeneity while leveraging both the unlabeled data and the inter-domain semantic class relationships for cross-domain knowledge transfer and adaptation. We conduct comprehensive experiments and the experimental results validate the efficacy and superior performance of the proposed Uni-HSSL over state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning and unsupervised domain adaptation methods. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00286v1) | N/A |

| SplatFlow: Multi-View Rectified Flow Model for 3D Gaussian Splatting Synthesis | Hyojun Go, Byeongjun Park, Jiho Jang, Jin-Young Kim, Soonwoo Kwon, Changick Kim | Text-based generation and editing of 3D scenes hold significant potential for streamlining content creation through intuitive user interactions. While recent advances leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for high-fidelity and real-time rendering, existing methods are often specialized and task-focused, lacking a unified framework for both generation and editing. In this paper, we introduce SplatFlow, a comprehensive framework that addresses this gap by enabling direct 3DGS generation and editing. SplatFlow comprises two main components: a multi-view rectified flow (RF) model and a Gaussian Splatting Decoder (GSDecoder). The multi-view RF model operates in latent space, generating multi-view images, depths, and camera poses simultaneously, conditioned on text prompts, thus addressing challenges like diverse scene scales and complex camera trajectories in real-world settings. Then, the GSDecoder efficiently translates these latent outputs into 3DGS representations through a feed-forward 3DGS method. Leveraging training-free inversion and inpainting techniques, SplatFlow enables seamless 3DGS editing and supports a broad range of 3D tasks-including object editing, novel view synthesis, and camera pose estimation-within a unified framework without requiring additional complex pipelines. We validate SplatFlow's capabilities on the MVImgNet and DL3DV-7K datasets, demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness in various 3D generation, editing, and inpainting-based tasks. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16443v1) | [https://github.com/nupurkmr9/vision-aided-gan](https://github.com/nupurkmr9/vision-aided-gan), [https://github.com/GaParmar/clean-fid](https://github.com/GaParmar/clean-fid), [https://gohyojun15.github.io/SplatFlow](https://gohyojun15.github.io/SplatFlow), [https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3-medium](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3-medium), [https://huggingface.co/depth-anything/Depth-Anything-V2-Small](https://huggingface.co/depth-anything/Depth-Anything-V2-Small) |

| Efficient Dynamic Scene Editing via 4D Gaussian-based Static-Dynamic Separation | JooHyun Kwon, Hanbyel Cho, Junmo Kim | Recent 4D dynamic scene editing methods require editing thousands of 2D images used for dynamic scene synthesis and updating the entire scene with additional training loops, resulting in several hours of processing to edit a single dynamic scene. Therefore, these methods are not scalable with respect to the temporal dimension of the dynamic scene (i.e., the number of timesteps). In this work, we propose an efficient dynamic scene editing method that is more scalable in terms of temporal dimension. To achieve computational efficiency, we leverage a 4D Gaussian representation that models a 4D dynamic scene by combining static 3D Gaussians with a Hexplane-based deformation field, which handles dynamic information. We then perform editing solely on the static 3D Gaussians, which is the minimal but sufficient component required for visual editing. To resolve the misalignment between the edited 3D Gaussians and the deformation field potentially resulting from the editing process, we additionally conducted a refinement stage using a score distillation mechanism. Extensive editing results demonstrate that our method is efficient, reducing editing time by more than half compared to existing methods, while achieving high editing quality that better follows user instructions. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02091v1) | N/A |
| D2SP: Dynamic Dual-Stage Purification Framework for Dual Noise Mitigation in Vision-based Affective Recognition | Haoran Wang, Xinji Mai, Zeng Tao, Xuan Tong, Junxiong Lin, Yan Wang, Jiawen Yu, Boyang Wang, Shaoqi Yan, Qing Zhao, Ziheng Zhou, Shuyong Gao, Wenqiang Zhang | The contemporary state-of-the-art of Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) technology facilitates remarkable progress by deriving emotional mappings of facial expressions from video content, underpinned by training on voluminous datasets. Yet, the DFER datasets encompass a substantial volume of noise data. Noise arises from low-quality captures that defy logical labeling, and instances that suffer from mislabeling due to annotation bias, engendering two principal types of uncertainty: the uncertainty regarding data usability and the uncertainty concerning label reliability. Addressing the two types of uncertainty, we have meticulously crafted a two-stage framework aiming at \textbf{S}eeking \textbf{C}ertain data \textbf{I}n extensive \textbf{U}ncertain data (SCIU). This initiative aims to purge the DFER datasets of these uncertainties, thereby ensuring that only clean, verified data is employed in training processes. To mitigate the issue of low-quality samples, we introduce the Coarse-Grained Pruning (CGP) stage, which assesses sample weights and prunes those deemed unusable due to their low weight. For samples with incorrect annotations, the Fine-Grained Correction (FGC) stage evaluates prediction stability to rectify mislabeled data. Moreover, SCIU is conceived as a universally compatible, plug-and-play framework, tailored to integrate seamlessly with prevailing DFER methodologies. Rigorous experiments across prevalent DFER datasets and against numerous benchmark methods substantiates SCIU's capacity to markedly elevate performance metrics. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.16473v2) | N/A |
| UniAP: Unifying Inter- and Intra-Layer Automatic Parallelism by Mixed Integer Quadratic Programming | Hao Lin, Ke Wu, Jie Li, Jun Li, Wu-Jun Li | Distributed learning is commonly used for training deep learning models, especially large models. In distributed learning, manual parallelism (MP) methods demand considerable human effort and have limited flexibility. Hence, automatic parallelism (AP) methods have recently been proposed for automating the parallel strategy optimization process. Existing AP methods suffer from sub-optimal solutions because they do not jointly optimize the two categories of parallel strategies (i.e., inter-layer parallelism and intra-layer parallelism). In this paper, we propose a novel AP method called UniAP, which unifies inter- and intra-layer automatic parallelism by mixed integer quadratic programming. To the best of our knowledge, UniAP is the first parallel method that can jointly optimize the two categories of parallel strategies to find an optimal solution. Experimental results show that UniAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 3.80$\times$ in throughput and reduces strategy optimization time by up to 107$\times$ across five Transformer-based models. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.16375v5) | [https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairscale](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairscale) |
| SIDA: Social Media Image Deepfake Detection, Localization and Explanation with Large Multimodal Model | Zhenglin Huang, Jinwei Hu, Xiangtai Li, Yiwei He, Xingyu Zhao, Bei Peng, Baoyuan Wu, Xiaowei Huang, Guangliang Cheng | The rapid advancement of generative models in creating highly realistic images poses substantial risks for misinformation dissemination. For instance, a synthetic image, when shared on social media, can mislead extensive audiences and erode trust in digital content, resulting in severe repercussions. Despite some progress, academia has not yet created a large and diversified deepfake detection dataset for social media, nor has it devised an effective solution to address this issue. In this paper, we introduce the Social media Image Detection dataSet (SID-Set), which offers three key advantages: (1) extensive volume, featuring 300K AI-generated/tampered and authentic images with comprehensive annotations, (2) broad diversity, encompassing fully synthetic and tampered images across various classes, and (3) elevated realism, with images that are predominantly indistinguishable from genuine ones through mere visual inspection. Furthermore, leveraging the exceptional capabilities of large multimodal models, we propose a new image deepfake detection, localization, and explanation framework, named SIDA (Social media Image Detection, localization, and explanation Assistant). SIDA not only discerns the authenticity of images, but also delineates tampered regions through mask prediction and provides textual explanations of the model's judgment criteria. Compared with state-of-the-art deepfake detection models on SID-Set and other benchmarks, extensive experiments demonstrate that SIDA achieves superior performance among diversified settings. The code, model, and dataset will be released. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.04292v1) | [https://github.com/Ekko-zn/AIGCDetectBenchmark](https://github.com/Ekko-zn/AIGCDetectBenchmark), [https://github.com/proteus1991/PSCC-Net](https://github.com/proteus1991/PSCC-Net), [https://github.com/nctu-eva-lab/AntifakePrompt](https://github.com/nctu-eva-lab/AntifakePrompt), [https://github.com/black-forest-labs/flux](https://github.com/black-forest-labs/flux), [https://hzlsaber.github.io/projects](https://hzlsaber.github.io/projects) |
| Relative Pose Estimation through Affine Corrections of Monocular Depth Priors | Yifan Yu, Shaohui Liu, Rémi Pautrat, Marc Pollefeys, Viktor Larsson | Monocular depth estimation (MDE) models have undergone significant advancements over recent years. Many MDE models aim to predict affine-invariant relative depth from monocular images, while recent developments in large-scale training and vision foundation models enable reasonable estimation of metric (absolute) depth. However, effectively leveraging these predictions for geometric vision tasks, in particular relative pose estimation, remains relatively under explored. While depths provide rich constraints for cross-view image alignment, the intrinsic noise and ambiguity from the monocular depth priors present practical challenges to improving upon classic keypoint-based solutions. In this paper, we develop three solvers for relative pose estimation that explicitly account for independent affine (scale and shift) ambiguities, covering both calibrated and uncalibrated conditions. We further propose a hybrid estimation pipeline that combines our proposed solvers with classic point-based solvers and epipolar constraints. We find that the affine correction modeling is beneficial to not only the relative depth priors but also, surprisingly, the ``metric" ones. Results across multiple datasets demonstrate large improvements of our approach over classic keypoint-based baselines and PnP-based solutions, under both calibrated and uncalibrated setups. We also show that our method improves consistently with different feature matchers and MDE models, and can further benefit from very recent advances on both modules.

| Interactive Medical Image Segmentation: A Benchmark Dataset and Baseline | Junlong Cheng, Bin Fu, Jin Ye, Guoan Wang, Tianbin Li, Haoyu Wang, Ruoyu Li, He Yao, Junren Chen, Jingwen Li, Yanzhou Su, Min Zhu, Junjun He | Interactive Medical Image Segmentation (IMIS) has long been constrained by the limited availability of large-scale, diverse, and densely annotated datasets, which hinders model generalization and consistent evaluation across different models. In this paper, we introduce the IMed-361M benchmark dataset, a significant advancement in general IMIS research. First, we collect and standardize over 6.4 million medical images and their corresponding ground truth masks from multiple data sources. Then, leveraging the strong object recognition capabilities of a vision foundational model, we automatically generated dense interactive masks for each image and ensured their quality through rigorous quality control and granularity management. Unlike previous datasets, which are limited by specific modalities or sparse annotations, IMed-361M spans 14 modalities and 204 segmentation targets, totaling 361 million masks-an average of 56 masks per image. Finally, we developed an IMIS baseline network on this dataset that supports high-quality mask generation through interactive inputs, including clicks, bounding boxes, text prompts, and their combinations. We evaluate its performance on medical image segmentation tasks from multiple perspectives, demonstrating superior accuracy and scalability compared to existing interactive segmentation models. To facilitate research on foundational models in medical computer vision, we release the IMed-361M and model at https://github.com/uni-medical/IMIS-Bench. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.12814v2) | [https://github.com/uni-medical/IMIS-Bench](https://github.com/uni-medical/IMIS-Bench), [https://github.com/myrthebuser/SPPIN2023](https://github.com/myrthebuser/SPPIN2023) |
| DEAL: Data-Efficient Adversarial Learning for High-Quality Infrared Imaging | Zhu Liu, Zijun Wang, Jinyuan Liu, Fanqi Meng, Long Ma, Risheng Liu | Thermal imaging is often compromised by dynamic, complex degradations caused by hardware limitations and unpredictable environmental factors. The scarcity of high-quality infrared data, coupled with the challenges of dynamic, intricate degradations, makes it difficult to recover details using existing methods. In this paper, we introduce thermal degradation simulation integrated into the training process via a mini-max optimization, by modeling these degraded factors as adversarial attacks on thermal images. The simulation is dynamic to maximize objective functions, thus capturing a broad spectrum of degraded data distributions. This approach enables training with limited data, thereby improving model performance.Additionally, we introduce a dual-interaction network that combines the benefits of spiking neural networks with scale transformation to capture degraded features with sharp spike signal intensities. This architecture ensures compact model parameters while preserving efficient feature representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only achieves superior visual quality under diverse single and composited degradation, but also delivers a significant reduction in processing when trained on only fifty clear images, outperforming existing techniques in efficiency and accuracy.

| MultiVENT 2.0: A Massive Multilingual Benchmark for Event-Centric Video Retrieval | Reno Kriz, Kate Sanders, David Etter, Kenton Murray, Cameron Carpenter, Kelly Van Ochten, Hannah Recknor, Jimena Guallar-Blasco, Alexander Martin, Ronald Colaianni, Nolan King, Eugene Yang, Benjamin Van Durme | Efficiently retrieving and synthesizing information from large-scale multimodal collections has become a critical challenge. However, existing video retrieval datasets suffer from scope limitations, primarily focusing on matching descriptive but vague queries with small collections of professionally edited, English-centric videos. To address this gap, we introduce $\textbf{MultiVENT 2.0}$, a large-scale, multilingual event-centric video retrieval benchmark featuring a collection of more than 218,000 news videos and 3,906 queries targeting specific world events. These queries specifically target information found in the visual content, audio, embedded text, and text metadata of the videos, requiring systems leverage all these sources to succeed at the task. Preliminary results show that state-of-the-art vision-language models struggle significantly with this task, and while alternative approaches show promise, they are still insufficient to adequately address this problem. These findings underscore the need for more robust multimodal retrieval systems, as effective video retrieval is a crucial step towards multimodal content understanding and generation. | [Arxiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.11619v2) | N/A |
| Efficient Video Face Enhancement with Enhanced Spatial-Temporal Consistency | Yutong Wang, Jiajie Teng, Jiajiong Cao, Yuming Li, Chenguang Ma, Hongteng Xu, Dixin Luo | As a very common type of video, face videos often appear in movies, talk shows, live broadcasts, and other scenes. Real-world online videos are often plagued by degradations such as blurring and quantization noise, due to the high compression ratio caused by high communication costs and limited transmission bandwidth. These degradations have a particularly serious impact on face videos because the human visual system is highly sensitive to facial details. Despite the significant advancement in video face enhancement, current methods still suffer from $i)$ long processing time and $ii)$ inconsistent spatial-temporal visual effects (e.g., flickering). This study proposes a novel and efficient blind video face enhancement method to overcome the above two challenges, restoring high-quality videos from their compressed low-quality versions with an effective de-flickering mechanism. In particular, the proposed method develops upon a 3D-VQGAN backbone associated with spatial-temporal codebooks recording high-quality portrait features and residual-based temporal information. We develop a two-stage learning framework for the model. In Stage \Rmnum{1}, we learn the model with a regularizer mitigating the codebook collapse problem. In Stage \Rmnum{2}, we learn two transformers to lookup code from the codebooks and further update the encoder of low-quality videos. Experiments conducted on the VFHQ-Test dataset demonstrate that our method surpasses the current state-of-the-art blind face video restoration and de-flickering methods on both efficiency and effectiveness.
